//! A very simple compute shader that updates a gpu buffer.

    // flipping ownership of the buffer over to the CPU and making access legal. We do this

    // we need to do instead is pass in a closure that will be executed when the slice is
    // either mapped or the mapping has failed.
    //
    // The problem with this is that we don't have a reliable way to wait in the main
    // code for the buffer to be mapped and even worse, calling get_mapped_range or
    // get_mapped_range_mut prematurely will cause a panic, not return an error.
    //
    // Using channels solves this as awaiting the receiving of a message from
    // the passed closure will force the outside code to wait. It also doesn't hurt
    // if the closure finishes before the outside code catches up as the message is
    // buffered and receiving will just pick that up.
    //
    // It may also be worth noting that although on native, the usage of asynchronous
    // channels is wholly unnecessary, for the sake of portability to WASM
