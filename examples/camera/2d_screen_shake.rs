//! This example showcases how to implement 2D screen shake.
//! It follows the GDC talk ["Math for Game Programmers: Juicing Your Cameras With Math"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-Qe66AvtY) by Squirrel Eiserloh
//!
//! The key features are:
//! - Camera shake is dependent on a "trauma" value between 0.0 and 1.0. The more trauma, the stronger the shake.
//! - Trauma automatically decays over time.
//! - The camera shake will always only affect the camera `Transform` up to a maximum displacement.
//! - The camera's `Transform` is only affected by the shake for the rendering. The `Transform` stays "normal" for the rest of the game logic.
//! - All displacements are governed by a noise function, guaranteeing that the shake is smooth and continuous.
//!   This means that the camera won't jump around wildly.
//!
//! ## Controls

    let (mut camera_shake, config, mut transform) = camera_shake.into_inner();

    // Before we even start thinking about the shake, we save the original transform so it's not lost.
    // At the start of the next frame, we will restore the camera's transform to this original transform.
    camera_shake.original_transform = *transform;

    // To generate the transform offset, we use a noise function. Noise is like a random number generator, but cooler.
    // Let's start with a visual intuition: <https://assets-global.website-files.com/64b6d182aee713bd0401f4b9/64b95974ec292aabac45fc8e_image.png>
    // The image on the left is made from pure randomness, the image on the right is made from a kind of noise called Perlin noise.
    // Notice how the noise has much more "structure" than the randomness? How it looks like it has peaks and valleys?
    // This property makes noise very desirable for a variety of visual effects. In our case, what we want is that the
    // camera does not wildly teleport around the world, but instead *moves* through the world frame by frame.
    // We can use 1D Perlin noise for this, which takes one input and outputs a value between -1.0 and 1.0. If we increase the input by a little bit,
    // like by the time since the last frame, we get a different output that is still "close" to the previous one.

    // This is the input to the noise function. Just using the elapsed time is pretty good input,
    // since it means that noise generations that are close in time will be close in output.
    // We simply multiply it by a constant to be able to "speed up" or "slow down" the noise.
    let t = time.elapsed_secs() * config.noise_speed;

    // Now we generate three noise values. One for the rotation, one for the x-offset, and one for the y-offset.
    // But if we generated those three noise values with the same input, we would get the same output three times!
    // To avoid this, we simply add a random offset to each input.
    // You can think of this as the seed value you would give a random number generator.
    let rotation_noise = perlin_noise::generate(t + 0.0);
    let x_noise = perlin_noise::generate(t + 100.0);
    let y_noise = perlin_noise::generate(t + 200.0);

    // Games often deal with linear increments. For example, if an enemy deals 10 damage and attacks you 2 times, you will take 20 damage.
    // But that's not how impact feels! Human senses are much more attuned to exponential changes.
    // So, we make sure that the `shake` value we use is an exponential function of the trauma.
    // But doesn't this make the value explode? Fortunately not: since `trauma` is between 0.0 and 1.0, exponentiating it will actually make it smaller!
    // See <https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=plot+x+and+x%5E2+and+x%5E3+for+x+in+%5B0%2C+1%5D> for a graph.
    let shake = powf(camera_shake.trauma, config.exponent);

    // Now, to get the final offset, we multiply this noise value by the shake value and the maximum value.
    // The noise value is in [-1, 1], so by multiplying it with a maximum value, we get a value in [-max_value, +max_value].
    // Multiply this by the shake value to get the exponential effect, and we're done!
    let roll_offset = rotation_noise * shake * config.max_angle;
    let x_offset = x_noise * shake * config.max_translation;
    let y_offset = y_noise * shake * config.max_translation;

    // Finally, we apply the offset to the camera's transform. Since we already stored the original transform,
    // and this system runs right at the end of the frame, we can't accidentally break any game logic by changing the transform.
    transform.translation.x += x_offset;
    transform.translation.y += y_offset;
    transform.rotate_z(roll_offset);
