//! This example showcases a 3D first-person camera.
//!
//! The setup presented here is a very common way of organizing a first-person game
//! where the player can see their own arms. We use two industry terms to differentiate
//! the kinds of models we have:
//!
//! - The *view model* is the model that represents the player's body.
//! - The *world model* is everything else.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! The reason for this distinction is that these two models should be rendered with different field of views (FOV).
//! The view model is typically designed and animated with a very specific FOV in mind, so it is
//! generally *fixed* and cannot be changed by a player. The world model, on the other hand, should
//! be able to change its FOV to accommodate the player's preferences for the following reasons:
//! - *Accessibility*: How prone is the player to motion sickness? A wider FOV can help.
//! - *Tactical preference*: Does the player want to see more of the battlefield?
//!     Or have a more zoomed-in view for precision aiming?
//! - *Physical considerations*: How well does the in-game FOV match the player's real-world FOV?
//!     Are they sitting in front of a monitor or playing on a TV in the living room? How big is the screen?
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! The `Player` is an entity holding two cameras, one for each model. The view model camera has a fixed
//! FOV of 70 degrees, while the world model camera has a variable FOV that can be changed by the player.
//!
//! We use different `RenderLayers` to select what to render.
//!
//! - The world model camera has no explicit `RenderLayers` component, so it uses the layer 0.
//!     All static objects in the scene are also on layer 0 for the same reason.
//! - The view model camera has a `RenderLayers` component with layer 1, so it only renders objects
//!     explicitly assigned to layer 1. The arm of the player is one such object.
//!     The order of the view model camera is additionally bumped to 1 to ensure it renders on top of the world model.
//! - The light source in the scene must illuminate both the view model and the world model, so it is
//!     assigned to both layers 0 and 1.
//!
//! ## Controls
//!
//! | Key Binding          | Action        |
//! |:---------------------|:--------------|
//! | mouse                | Look around   |
//! | arrow up             | Decrease FOV  |
//! | arrow down           | Increase FOV  |
