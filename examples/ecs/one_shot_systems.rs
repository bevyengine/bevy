//! Demonstrates the use of "one-shot systems", which run once when triggered.
//!
//! These can be useful to help structure your logic in a push-based fashion,
//! reducing the overhead of running extremely rarely run systems
//! and improving schedule flexibility.
//!
//! See the [`World::run_system`](World::run_system) or
//! [`World::run_system_once`](World#method.run_system_once_with)
//! docs for more details.
