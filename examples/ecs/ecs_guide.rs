//! This is a guided introduction to Bevy's "Entity Component System" (ECS)
//! All Bevy app logic is built using the ECS pattern, so definitely pay attention!
//!
//! Why ECS?
//! * Data oriented: Functionality is driven by data
//! * Clean Architecture: Loose coupling of functionality / prevents deeply nested inheritance
//! * High Performance: Massively parallel and cache friendly
//!
//! ECS Definitions:
//!
//! Component: just a normal Rust data type. generally scoped to a single piece of functionality
//!     Examples: position, velocity, health, color, name
//!
//! Entity: a collection of components with a unique id
//!     Examples: Entity1 { Name("Alice"), Position(0, 0) },
//!               Entity2 { Name("Bill"), Position(10, 5) }
//!
//! Resource: a shared global piece of data
//!     Examples: asset storage, events, system state
//!
//! System: runs logic on entities, components, and resources
//!     Examples: move system, damage system
//!
//! Now that you know a little bit about ECS, lets look at some Bevy code!
//! We will now make a simple "game" to illustrate what Bevy's ECS looks like in practice.

    app::{AppExit, ScheduleRunnerPlugin, ScheduleRunnerSettings},

    utils::Duration,

// COMPONENTS: Pieces of functionality we add to entities. These are just normal Rust data types
//

// Our game will have a number of "players". Each player has a name that identifies them
#[derive(Component)]
struct Player {
    name: String,
}

// Each player also has a score. This component holds on to that score
#[derive(Component)]
struct Score {
    value: usize,
}

// RESOURCES: "Global" state accessible by systems. These are also just normal Rust data types!
//

// This resource holds information about the game:
#[derive(Resource, Default)]
struct GameState {
    current_round: usize,
    total_players: usize,
    winning_player: Option<String>,
}

// This resource provides rules for our "game".
#[derive(Resource)]
struct GameRules {
    winning_score: usize,
    max_rounds: usize,
    max_players: usize,
}

// SYSTEMS: Logic that runs on entities, components, and resources. These generally run once each
// time the app updates.
//

// This is the simplest type of system. It just prints "This game is fun!" on each run:
fn print_message_system() {
    println!("This game is fun!");
}

// Systems can also read and modify resources. This system starts a new "round" on each update:
// NOTE: "mut" denotes that the resource is "mutable"
// Res<GameRules> is read-only. ResMut<GameState> can modify the resource

// Sometimes systems need to be stateful. Bevy's ECS provides the `Local` system parameter

// Therefore, on the first turn, `counter` has a value of 0.
