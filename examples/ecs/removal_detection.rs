//! This example shows how you can know when a `Component` has been removed, so you can react to it.

use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Information regarding removed `Component`s is discarded at the end of each frame, so you need
    // to react to the removal before the frame is over.
    //
    // Also, `Components` are removed via a `Command`. `Command`s are applied after a stage has
    // finished executing. So you need to react to the removal at some stage after the
    // `Component` is removed.
    //
    // With these constraints in mind we make sure to place the system that removes a `Component` on
    // the `CoreStage::Update' stage, and the system that reacts on the removal on the
    // `CoreStage::PostUpdate` stage.
