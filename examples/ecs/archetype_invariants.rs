//! Archetype invariants are rules about which combinations of components can coexist.
//!
//! An archetype (in the sense that Bevy uses it) is the "unique set of components" that belong to an entity.
//! These are useful to codify your assumptions about the composition of your entities.
//! For example, an entity can never have a `Player` component with a `Camera` together,
//! or a `GlobalTransform` may only be valid in association with a `Transform`.
//! By constructing `ArchetypeInvariant`s out of `ArchetypeStatement`s,
//! we can encode this logic into our app.
//!
//! Archetype invariants are guaranteed to hold at *all* points during the app's lifecycle;
//! this is automtically checked on component insertion and removal, including when entities are spawned.
//! Make sure to test thoroughly when using archetype invariants in production though;
//! any violations will result in a panic!
//!
//! There are many helper methods provided on `ArchetypeInvariant` to help easily construct common invariant patterns,
//! but we will only be showcasing some of them here.
//! For a full list, see the docs for `ArchetypeInvariant`.
