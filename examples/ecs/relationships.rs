//! Entities generally don't exist in isolation. Instead, they are related to other entities in various ways.
//! While Bevy comes with a built-in [`ChildOf`]/[`Children`] relationship
//! (which enables transform and visibility propagation),
//! you can define your own relationships using components.
//!
//! We can define a custom relationship by creating two components:
//! one to store the relationship itself, and another to keep track of the reverse relationship.
//! Bevy's [`ChildOf`] component implements the [`Relationship`] trait, serving as the source of truth,
//! while the [`Children`] component implements the [`RelationshipTarget`] trait and is used to accelerate traversals down the hierarchy.
//!
//! In this example we're creating a [`Targeting`]/[`TargetedBy`] relationship,
//! demonstrating how you might model units which target a single unit in combat.
