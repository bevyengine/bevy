//! Shows how to return to the calling function after a windowed Bevy app has exited.
//!
//! In windowed *Bevy* applications, executing code below a call to `App::run()` is
//! not recommended because:
//! - `App::run()` will never return on iOS and Web.
//! - It is not possible to recreate a window afer the event loop has been terminated.
