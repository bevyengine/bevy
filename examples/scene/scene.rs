//! This example demonstrates how to load scene data from files and then dynamically
//! apply that data to entities in your Bevy `World`. This includes spawning new
//! entities and applying updates to existing ones. Scenes in Bevy encapsulate
//! serialized and deserialized `Components` or `Resources` so that you can easily
//! store, load, and manipulate data outside of a purely code-driven context.
//!
//! This example also shows how to do the following:
//! * Register your custom types for reflection, which allows them to be serialized,
//!   deserialized, and manipulated dynamically.
//! * Skip serialization of fields you don't want stored in your scene files (like
//!   runtime values that should always be computed dynamically).
//! * Save a new scene to disk to show how it can be updated compared to the original
//!   scene file (and how that updated scene file might then be used later on).
//!
//! The example proceeds by creating components and resources, registering their types,
//! loading a scene from a file, logging when changes are detected, and finally saving
//! a new scene file to disk. This is useful for anyone wanting to see how to integrate
//! file-based scene workflows into their Bevy projects.
//!
//! # Note on working with files
//!
//! The saving behavior uses the standard filesystem APIs, which are blocking, so it
//! utilizes a thread pool (`IoTaskPool`) to avoid stalling the main thread. This
//! won't work on WASM because WASM typically doesn't have direct filesystem access.

/// # Components, Resources, and Reflection
///
/// Below are some simple examples of how to define your own Bevy `Component` types
/// and `Resource` types so that they can be properly reflected, serialized, and
/// deserialized. The `#[derive(Reflect)]` macro enables Bevy's reflection features,
/// and we add component-specific reflection by using `#[reflect(Component)]`.
/// We also illustrate how to skip serializing fields and how `FromWorld` can help
/// create runtime-initialized data.
///
/// A sample component that is fully serializable.
///
/// This component has public `x` and `y` fields that will be included in
/// the scene files. Notice how it derives `Default`, `Reflect`, and declares
/// itself as a reflected component with `#[reflect(Component)]`.
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Default)]
#[reflect(Component)] // this tells the reflect derive to also reflect component behaviors

    /// An example `f32` field
    pub x: f32,
    /// Another example `f32` field
    pub y: f32,

///
/// This is useful for skipping serialization of runtime data or fields you
/// don't want written to scene files.

    /// A string field that will be serialized.
