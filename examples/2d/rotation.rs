/// will return a value between -1.0 and +1.0 which tells us the following about the two vectors:
///
/// * If the result is 1.0 the vectors are pointing in the same direction, the angle between them
///   is 0 degrees.
/// * If the result is 0.0 the vectors are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees.
/// * If the result is -1.0 the vectors are parallel but pointing in opposite directions, the angle
///   between them is 180 degrees.
/// * If the result is positive the vectors are pointing in roughly the same direction, the angle
///   between them is greater than 0 and less than 90 degrees.
/// * If the result is negative the vectors are pointing in roughly opposite directions, the angle
///   between them is greater than 90 and less than 180 degrees.
///
/// It is possible to get the angle by taking the arc cosine (`acos`) of the dot product. It is
/// often unnecessary to do this though. Beware than `acos` will return `NaN` if the input is less
/// than -1.0 or greater than 1.0. This can happen even when working with unit vectors due to
/// floating point precision loss, so it pays to clamp your dot product value before calling
