//! This example shows how to properly handle player input,
//! advance a physics simulation in a fixed timestep, and display the results.
//!
//! The classic source for how and why this is done is Glenn Fiedler's article
//! [Fix Your Timestep!](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/).
//! For a more Bevy-centric source, see
//! [this cheatbook entry](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/fundamentals/fixed-timestep.html).
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! The naive way of moving a player is to just update their position like so:
//! ```no_run
//! transform.translation += velocity;
//! ```
//! The issue here is that the player's movement speed will be tied to the frame rate.
//! Faster machines will move the player faster, and slower machines will move the player slower.
//! In fact, you can observe this today when running some old games that did it this way on modern hardware!
//! The player will move at a breakneck pace.
//!
//! The more sophisticated way is to update the player's position based on the time that has passed:
//! ```no_run
//! transform.translation += velocity * time.delta_secs();
//! ```
//! This way, velocity represents a speed in units per second, and the player will move at the same speed
//! regardless of the frame rate.
//!
//! However, this can still be problematic if the frame rate is very low or very high.
//! If the frame rate is very low, the player will move in large jumps. This may lead to
//! a player moving in such large jumps that they pass through walls or other obstacles.
//! In general, you cannot expect a physics simulation to behave nicely with *any* delta time.
//! Ideally, we want to have some stability in what kinds of delta times we feed into our physics simulation.
//!
//! The solution is using a fixed timestep. This means that we advance the physics simulation by a fixed amount
//! at a time. If the real time that passed between two frames is less than the fixed timestep, we simply
//! don't advance the physics simulation at all.
//! If it is more, we advance the physics simulation multiple times until we catch up.
//! You can read more about how Bevy implements this in the documentation for
//! [`bevy::time::Fixed`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/time/struct.Fixed.html).
//!
//! This leaves us with a last problem, however. If our physics simulation may advance zero or multiple times
//! per frame, there may be frames in which the player's position did not need to be updated at all,
//! and some where it is updated by a large amount that resulted from running the physics simulation multiple times.
//! This is physically correct, but visually jarring. Imagine a player moving in a straight line, but depending on the frame rate,
//! they may sometimes advance by a large amount and sometimes not at all. Visually, we want the player to move smoothly.
//! This is why we need to separate the player's position in the physics simulation from the player's position in the visual representation.
//! The visual representation can then be interpolated smoothly based on the previous and current actual player position in the physics simulation.
//!
//! This is a tradeoff: every visual frame is now slightly lagging behind the actual physical frame,
//! but in return, the player's movement will appear smooth.
//! There are other ways to compute the visual representation of the player, such as extrapolation.
//! See the [documentation of the lightyear crate](https://cbournhonesque.github.io/lightyear/book/concepts/advanced_replication/visual_interpolation.html)
//! for a nice overview of the different methods and their respective tradeoffs.
//!
//! If we decide to use a fixed timestep, our game logic should mostly go in the `FixedUpdate` schedule.
//! One notable exception is the camera. Cameras should update as often as possible, or the player will very quickly
//! notice choppy movement if it's only updated at the same rate as the physics simulation. So, we use a variable timestep for the camera,
//! updating its transform every frame. The question now is which schedule to use. That depends on whether the camera data is required
//! for the physics simulation to run or not.
//! For example, in 3D games, the camera rotation often determines which direction the player moves when pressing "W",
//! so we need to rotate the camera *before* the fixed timestep. In contrast, the translation of the camera depends on what the physics simulation
//! has calculated for the player's position. Therefore, we need to update the camera's translation *after* the fixed timestep. Fortunately,
//! we can get smooth movement by simply using the interpolated player translation for the camera as well.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! - The player's inputs since the last physics update are stored in the `AccumulatedInput` component.
//! - The player's velocity is stored in a `Velocity` component. This is the speed in units per second.
//! - The player's current position in the physics simulation is stored in a `PhysicalTranslation` component.
//! - The player's previous position in the physics simulation is stored in a `PreviousPhysicalTranslation` component.
//! - The player's visual representation is stored in Bevy's regular `Transform` component.
//! - Every frame, we go through the following steps:
//!   - Accumulate the player's input and set the current speed in the `handle_input` system.
//!     This is run in the `RunFixedMainLoop` schedule, ordered in `RunFixedMainLoopSystems::BeforeFixedMainLoop`,
//!     which runs before the fixed timestep loop. This is run every frame.
//!   - Rotate the camera based on the player's input. This is also run in `RunFixedMainLoopSystems::BeforeFixedMainLoop`.
//!   - Advance the physics simulation by one fixed timestep in the `advance_physics` system.
//!     Accumulated input is consumed here.
//!     This is run in the `FixedUpdate` schedule, which runs zero or multiple times per frame.
//!   - Update the player's visual representation in the `interpolate_rendered_transform` system.
//!     This interpolates between the player's previous and current position in the physics simulation.
//!     It is run in the `RunFixedMainLoop` schedule, ordered in `RunFixedMainLoopSystems::AfterFixedMainLoop`,
//!     which runs after the fixed timestep loop. This is run every frame.
//!   - Update the camera's translation to the player's interpolated translation. This is also run in `RunFixedMainLoopSystems::AfterFixedMainLoop`.
//!
