# Stress tests

These examples are used to stress test Bevy's performance in various ways. 
These should be run with the "stress-test" profile, otherwise they will be very slow or inaccurately represent production level performance.

## Example Command

```
cargo run --example <EXAMPLE> --profile stress-test
```
