# B0005

A runtime warning.

Separate font atlases are created for each font and font size. This is expensive, and the memory is never reclaimed when e.g. interpolating `TextStyle::font_size` or `UiScale::scale`.

If you need to smoothly scale font size, use `Transform::scale`.

You can disable this warning by setting `TextPlugin::max_font_sizes` to `None` or `Some(larger_value)`.
