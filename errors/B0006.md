# B0006

A runtime warning.

Bevy's renderer is designed to be used with hardware acceleration. When initializing the renderer, Bevy will print an `AdapterInfo` line. If the driver in the `AdapterInfo` is indicated to be a software renderer, then the driver does not support hardware acceleration and Bevy will most likely be slow.

## Possible solutions

- Update your graphics driver. Your driver could simply be outdated.
- Try using a different backend for the `RenderPlugin`, for example the OpenGL backend:

```rust
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(
            DefaultPlugins.set(RenderPlugin {
                render_creation: WgpuSettings {
                    backends: Some(Backends::GL),
                    ..default()
                }
                .into(),
                ..default()
            }),
        )
        .run();
}
```

The backend can also be configured using environment variables, by setting `WGPU_BACKEND=[backend]` on Linux/Mac or `set WGPU_BACKEND=[backend]` on Windows, where `[backend]` is one of `vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12`, or `gl`.

- It is possible that the hardware itself is too old.
