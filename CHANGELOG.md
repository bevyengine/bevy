  - `query.iter()` is now a real iterator!
  - `QuerySet` allows working with conflicting queries and is checked at compile-time.
- [Rename `query.entity()` and `query.get()`][752]

  - For missing attributes (requested by shader, but not defined by mesh), Bevy will provide a zero-filled fallback buffer.
