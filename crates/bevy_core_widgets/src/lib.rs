//! This crate provides a set of core widgets for Bevy UI, such as buttons, checkboxes, and sliders.
//! These widgets have no inherent styling, it's the responsibility of the user to add styling
//! appropriate for their game or application.
//!
//! # State Management
//!
//! Most of the widgets use external state management: this means that the widgets do not
//! automatically update their own internal state, but instead rely on the app to update the widget
//! state (as well as any other related game state) in response to a change event emitted by the
//! widget. The primary motivation for this is to avoid two-way data binding in scenarios where the
//! user interface is showing a live view of dynamic data coming from deeper within the game engine.
