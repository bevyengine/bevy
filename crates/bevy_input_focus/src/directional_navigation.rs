//! A navigation framework for moving between focusable elements based on directional input.
//!
//! While virtual cursors are a common way to navigate UIs with a gamepad (or arrow keys!),
//! they are generally both slow and frustrating to use.
//! Instead, directional inputs should provide a direct way to snap between focusable elements.
//!
//! Like the rest of this crate, the [`InputFocus`] resource is manipulated to track
//! the current focus.
//!
//! Navigating between focusable entities (commonly UI nodes) is done by
//! passing a [`CompassOctant`] into the [`navigate`](DirectionalNavigation::navigate) method
//! from the [`DirectionalNavigation`] system parameter.
//!
//! Under the hood, the [`DirectionalNavigationMap`] stores a directed graph of focusable entities.
//! Each entity can have up to 8 neighbors, one for each [`CompassOctant`], balancing flexibility and required precision.
//! For now, this graph must be built manually, but in the future, it could be generated automatically.
