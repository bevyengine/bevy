//! This crate provides 'picking' capabilities for the Bevy game engine. That means, in simple terms, figuring out
//! how to connect up a user's clicks or taps to the entities they are trying to interact with.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! In the simplest case, this plugin allows you to click on things in the scene. However, it also
//! allows you to express more complex interactions, like detecting when a touch input drags a UI
//! element and drops it on a 3d mesh rendered to a different camera. The crate also provides a set of
//! interaction callbacks, allowing you to receive input directly on entities like here:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_picking::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Component)]
//! # struct MyComponent;
//! # let mut world = World::new();
//! world.spawn(MyComponent)
//!     .observe(|mut trigger: Trigger<Pointer<Click>>| {
//!         // Get the underlying event type
//!         let click_event: &Pointer<Click> = trigger.event();
//!         // Stop the event from bubbling up the entity hierarchjy
//!         trigger.propagate(false);
//!     });
//! ```
//!
//! At its core, this crate provides a robust abstraction for computing picking state regardless of
//! pointing devices, or what you are hit testing against. It is designed to work with any input, including
//! mouse, touch, pens, or virtual pointers controlled by gamepads.
//!
//! ## Expressive Events
//!
//! The events in this module (see [`events`]) cannot be listened to with normal `EventReader`s.
//! Instead, they are dispatched to *ovservers* attached to specific entities. When events are generated, they
//! bubble up the entity hierarchy starting from their target, until they reach the root or bubbling is haulted
//! with a call to [`Trigger::propagate`](bevy_ecs::observer::Trigger::propagate).
//! See [`Observer`] for details.
//!
//! This allows you to run callbacks when any children of an entity are interacted with, and leads
//! to succinct, expressive code:
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_transform::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_picking::prelude::*;
//! # #[derive(Event)]
//! # struct Greeting;
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     commands.spawn(Transform::default())
//!         // Spawn your entity here, e.g. a Mesh.
//!         // When dragged, mutate the `Transform` component on the dragged target entity:
//!         .observe(|trigger: Trigger<Pointer<Drag>>, mut transforms: Query<&mut Transform>| {
//!             let mut transform = transforms.get_mut(trigger.entity()).unwrap();
//!             let drag = trigger.event();
//!             transform.rotate_local_y(drag.delta.x / 50.0);
//!         })
//!         .observe(|trigger: Trigger<Pointer<Click>>, mut commands: Commands| {
//!             println!("Entity {:?} goes BOOM!", trigger.entity());
//!             commands.entity(trigger.entity()).despawn();
//!         })
//!         .observe(|trigger: Trigger<Pointer<Over>>, mut events: EventWriter<Greeting>| {
//!             events.send(Greeting);
//!         });
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Modularity
//!
//! #### Mix and Match Hit Testing Backends
//!
//! The plugin attempts to handle all the hard parts for you, all you need to do is tell it when a
//! pointer is hitting any entities. Multiple backends can be used at the same time! [Use this
//! simple API to write your own backend](crate::backend) in about 100 lines of code.
//!
//! #### Input Agnostic
//!
//! Picking provides a generic Pointer abstracton, which is useful for reacting to many different
//! types of input devices. Pointers can be controlled with anything, whether its the included mouse
//! or touch inputs, or a custom gamepad input system you write yourself to control a virtual pointer.
//!
//! ## Robustness
//!
//! In addition to these features, this plugin also correctly handles multitouch, multiple windows,
//! multiple cameras, viewports, and render layers. Using this as a library allows you to write a
//! picking backend that can interoperate with any other picking backend.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! TODO: This section will need to be re-written once more backends are introduced.
//!
//! #### Next Steps
//!
//! To learn more, take a look at the examples in the
//! [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/examples/picking). You
//! can read the next section to understand how the plugin works.
//!
//! # The Picking Pipeline
//!
//! This plugin is designed to be extremely modular. To do so, it works in well-defined stages that
//! form a pipeline, where events are used to pass data between each stage.
//!
//! #### Pointers ([`pointer`](mod@pointer))
//!
//! The first stage of the pipeline is to gather inputs and update pointers. This stage is
//! ultimately responsible for generating [`PointerInput`](pointer::PointerInput) events. The provided
//! crate does this automatically for mouse, touch, and pen inputs. If you wanted to implement your own
//! pointer, controlled by some other input, you can do that here. The ordering of events within the
//! [`PointerInput`](pointer::PointerInput) stream is meaningful for events with the same
//! [`PointerId`](pointer::PointerId), but not between different pointers.
//!
//! Because pointer positions and presses are driven by these events, you can use them to mock
//! inputs for testing.
//!
//! After inputs are generated, they are then collected to update the current
//! [`PointerLocation`](pointer::PointerLocation) for each pointer.
//!
//! #### Backend ([`backend`])
//!
//! A picking backend only has one job: reading [`PointerLocation`](pointer::PointerLocation) components,
//! and producing [`PointerHits`](backend::PointerHits). You can find all documentation and types needed to
//! implement a backend at [`backend`].
//!
//! You will eventually need to choose which picking backend(s) you want to use. This crate does not
//! supply any backends, and expects you to select some from the other bevy crates or the third-party
//! ecosystem. You can find all the provided backends in the [`backend`] module.
//!
//! It's important to understand that you can mix and match backends! For example, you might have a
//! backend for your UI, and one for the 3d scene, with each being specialized for their purpose.
//! This crate provides some backends out of the box, but you can even write your own. It's been
//! made as easy as possible intentionally; the `bevy_mod_raycast` backend is 50 lines of code.
//!
//! #### Focus ([`focus`])
//!
//! The next step is to use the data from the backends, combine and sort the results, and determine
//! what each cursor is hovering over, producing a [`HoverMap`](`crate::focus::HoverMap`). Note that
//! just because a pointer is over an entity, it is not necessarily *hovering* that entity. Although
//! multiple backends may be reporting that a pointer is hitting an entity, the focus system needs
//! to determine which entities are actually being hovered by this pointer based on the pick depth,
//! order of the backend, and the optional [`PickingBehavior`] component of the entity. In other words,
//! if one entity is in front of another, usually only the topmost one will be hovered.
//!
//! #### Events ([`events`])
//!
//! In the final step, the high-level pointer events are generated, such as events that trigger when
//! a pointer hovers or clicks an entity. These simple events are then used to generate more complex
//! events for dragging and dropping.
//!
//! Because it is completely agnostic to the the earlier stages of the pipeline, you can easily
//! extend the plugin with arbitrary backends and input methods, yet still use all the high level
//! features.
