//! This module contains a basic backend that implements picking for window
//! entities.
//!
//! Pointers can exist on windows, images, and gpu texture views. With
//! [`update_window_hits`] enabled, when a pointer hovers over a window that
//! window will be inserted as a pointer hit, listed behind all other pointer
//! hits. This means that when the pointer isn't hovering any other entities,
//! the picking events will be routed to the window.
