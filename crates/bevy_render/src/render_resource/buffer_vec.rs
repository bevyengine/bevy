/// "Properly formatted" means that item data already meets the alignment and padding
/// requirements for how it will be used on the GPU. The item type must implement [`Pod`]
/// for its data representation to be directly copyable.
///
/// Index, vertex, and instance-rate vertex buffers have no alignment nor padding requirements and
/// so this helper type is a good choice for them.

/// The contained data is stored in system RAM. Calling [`reserve`](crate::render_resource::BufferVec::reserve)
/// allocates VRAM from the [`RenderDevice`](crate::renderer::RenderDevice).
/// [`write_buffer`](crate::render_resource::BufferVec::write_buffer) queues copying of the data
/// from system RAM to VRAM.
///
/// Other options for storing GPU-accessible data are:
/// * [`DynamicStorageBuffer`](crate::render_resource::DynamicStorageBuffer)
