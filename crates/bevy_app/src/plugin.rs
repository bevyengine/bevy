/// A collection of Bevy app logic and configuration.
///
/// Plugins configure an [`App`]. When an [`App`] registers a plugin,
/// the plugin's [`Plugin::build`] function is run. By default, a plugin
/// can only be added once to an [`App`].
///
/// If the plugin may need to be added twice or more, the function [`is_unique()`](Self::is_unique)
/// should be overridden to return `false`. Plugins are considered duplicate if they have the same
/// [`name()`](Self::name). The default `name()` implementation returns the type name, which means
/// generic plugins with different type parameters will not be considered duplicates.
///
/// ## Lifecycle of a plugin
///
/// When adding a plugin to an [`App`]:
/// * the app calls [`Plugin::build`] immediately, and register the plugin
/// * once the app started, it will wait for all registered [`Plugin::ready`] to return `true`
/// * it will then call all registered [`Plugin::finish`]
/// * and call all registered [`Plugin::cleanup`]
///
/// ## Defining a plugin.
///
/// Most plugins are simply functions that add configuration to an [`App`].
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_app::{App, Update};
/// App::new().add_plugins(my_plugin).run();
///
/// // This function implements `Plugin`, along with every other `fn(&mut App)`.
/// pub fn my_plugin(app: &mut App) {
///     app.add_systems(Update, hello_world);
/// }
/// # fn hello_world() {}
/// ```
///
/// For more advanced use cases, the `Plugin` trait can be implemented manually for a type.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_app::*;
/// pub struct AccessibilityPlugin {
///     pub flicker_damping: bool,
///     // ...
