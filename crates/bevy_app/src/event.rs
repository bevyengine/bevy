/// # Example
/// ```
/// use bevy_app::Events;
///
/// struct MyEvent {
///     value: usize
/// }
///
/// // setup
/// let mut events = Events::<MyEvent>::default();
/// let mut reader = events.get_reader();
///
/// // run this once per update/frame
/// events.update();
///
/// // somewhere else: send an event
/// events.send(MyEvent { value: 1 });
///
/// // somewhere else: read the events
/// for event in reader.iter(&events) {
///     assert_eq!(event.value, 1)

/// # Details
///
/// [Events] is implemented using a double buffer. Each call to [Events::update] swaps buffers and clears out the oldest buffer.
/// [EventReader]s that read at least once per update will never drop events. [EventReader]s that read once within two updates might
/// still receive some events. [EventReader]s that read after two updates are guaranteed to drop all events that occurred before those updates.
///
/// The buffers in [Events] will grow indefinitely if [Events::update] is never called.
///
/// An alternative call pattern would be to call [Events::update] manually across frames to control when events are cleared. However
/// this complicates consumption
