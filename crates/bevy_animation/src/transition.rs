/// Component responsible for managing transitions between multiple nodes or states.
///
/// It supports multiple independent "flows", where each flow represents a distinct active
/// animation or state machine. A flow tracks the transition between two states over time.
///
/// In the simplest case, `flow_amount` should be set to `1`, indicating a single flow.
/// However, if multiple state machines or simultaneous animations are needed, `flow_amount`
/// should be increased accordingly.
///
/// Is worth mentioning, that when using `AnimationTransitions`, you should avoid messing around with player!
/// As he will do the heavy lifting for you! All you need to worry about is transitioning your flows!
/// If you do play an additional animation directly via player  this WILL BREAK!
///
/// It is also the user's responsibility to track which flow they are currently operating on
/// when triggering transitions.
/// Ex: Flow 0 - Plays idle,walks and so on. Affect whole body
/// Flow 1 - Plays close hands - Affects only hand bones.
