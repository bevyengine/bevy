/// A graph structure that describes how animation clips are to be blended
/// together.
///
/// Applications frequently want to be able to play multiple animations at once
/// and to fine-tune the influence that animations have on a skinned mesh. Bevy
/// uses an *animation graph* to store this information. Animation graphs are a
/// directed acyclic graph (DAG) that describes how animations are to be
/// weighted and combined together. Every frame, Bevy evaluates the graph from
/// the root and blends the animations together in a bottom-up fashion to
/// produce the final pose.
///
/// There are three types of nodes: *blend nodes*, *add nodes*, and *clip
/// nodes*, all of which can have an associated weight. Blend nodes and add
/// nodes have no associated animation clip and combine the animations of their
/// children according to those children's weights. Clip nodes specify an
/// animation clip to play. When a graph is created, it starts with only a
/// single blend node, the root node.
///
/// For example, consider the following graph:
///
/// ```text
/// ┌────────────┐                                      
/// │            │

///
/// In this case, assuming that Idle, Run, and Walk are all playing with weight
/// 1.0, the Run and Walk animations will be equally blended together, then
/// their weights will be halved and finally blended with the Idle animation.
/// Thus the weight of Run and Walk are effectively half of the weight of Idle.
///
/// Nodes can optionally have a *mask*, a bitfield that restricts the set of
/// animation targets that the node and its descendants affect. Each bit in the
/// mask corresponds to a *mask group*, which is a set of animation targets
/// (bones). An animation target can belong to any number of mask groups within
/// the context of an animation graph.
///
/// When the appropriate bit is set in a node's mask, neither the node nor its
/// descendants will animate any animation targets belonging to that mask group.
/// That is, setting a mask bit to 1 *disables* the animation targets in that
/// group. If an animation target belongs to multiple mask groups, masking any
/// one of the mask groups that it belongs to will mask that animation target.
/// (Thus an animation target will only be animated if *all* of its mask groups
/// are unmasked.)
///
/// A common use of masks is to allow characters to hold objects. For this, the
/// typical workflow is to assign each character's hand to a mask group. Then,
/// when the character picks up an object, the application masks out the hand
/// that the object is held in for the character's animation set, then positions
/// the hand's digits as necessary to grasp the object. The character's
/// animations will continue to play but will not affect the hand, which will
/// continue to be depicted as holding the object.
///

/// files. Canonically, such files have an `.animgraph.ron` extension.
