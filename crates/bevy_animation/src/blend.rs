/// A type with a natural method of addative blending.
///
/// Any type with a well-behaved method of composition which also implements the [`Interpolate`] trait
/// can support addative blending. Specifically, the type must:
///
/// 1. Have a natural method of composition. For vectors this is addition, for quaternions or rotations
///    composition is usually expressed as multiplication. We'll use `comp(a, b)` to denote this operation.
///
/// 2. The operation must be associative. That is, `comp(comp(a, b), c)` must be equivalent to
///    `comp(a, comp(b, c))`. The result does not need to be data-identical, but it should be equivalent
///    under some reasonable notion of equivalence.
///
/// 2. Have an `IDENTITY` value such that composition with the identity is equivalent in some way to the
///    original value.
///
/// 3. The value of `T::blend(a, b, w)` should be equivalent to `comp(a, interp(IDENTITY, b, w))`. This implies
///    that `T::blend(a, b, 0)` is equivalent to `a` and `T::blend(a, b, 1)` is equivalent to `comp(a, b)`.
///
/// Some of you will have noticed that these rules encodes the axioms for a Monoid; In fact this trait
/// represents something similar to a Lie Group.
