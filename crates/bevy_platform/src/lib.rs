/// required due to the change in implicit prelude from `std::prelude` to `core::prelude`.
/// This unfortunately leaves out many items from `alloc`, even if the crate unconditionally
/// includes that crate.
///
/// This prelude aims to ease the transition by re-exporting items from `alloc` which would
/// otherwise be included in the `std` implicit prelude.
