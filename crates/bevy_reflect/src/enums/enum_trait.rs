/// A trait representing a [reflected] enum.
///
/// This allows enums to be processed and modified dynamically at runtime without
/// necessarily knowing the actual type.
/// Enums are much more complex than their struct counterparts.
/// As a result, users will need to be mindful of conventions, considerations,
/// and complications when working with this trait.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// An enum is a set of choices called _variants_.
/// An instance of an enum can only exist as one of these choices at any given time.
/// Consider Rust's [`Option<T>`]. It's an enum with two variants: [`None`] and [`Some`].
/// If you're `None`, you can't be `Some` and vice versa.
///
/// > ⚠️ __This is very important:__
/// > The [`Enum`] trait represents an enum _as one of its variants_.
/// > It does not represent the entire enum since that's not true to how enums work.
///
/// Variants come in a few [flavors](VariantType):
///
/// | Variant Type | Syntax                         |
/// | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
/// | Unit         | `MyEnum::Foo`                  |
/// | Tuple        | `MyEnum::Foo( i32, i32 )`      |
/// | Struct       | `MyEnum::Foo{ value: String }` |
///
/// As you can see, a unit variant contains no fields, while tuple and struct variants
/// can contain one or more fields.
/// The fields in a tuple variant is defined by their _order_ within the variant.
/// Index `0` represents the first field in the variant and so on.
/// Fields in struct variants (excluding tuple structs), on the other hand, are
/// represented by a _name_.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// > 💡 This trait can be automatically implemented using the [`Reflect`] derive macro
/// > on an enum definition.
///
/// Despite the fact that enums can represent multiple states, traits only exist in one state
/// and must be applied to the entire enum rather than a particular variant.
/// Because of this limitation, the [`Enum`] trait must not only _represent_ any of the
/// three variant types, but also define the _methods_ for all three as well.
///
/// What does this mean? It means that even though a unit variant contains no fields, a
/// representation of that variant using the [`Enum`] trait will still contain methods for
/// accessing fields!
/// Again, this is to account for _all three_ variant types.
///
/// We recommend using the built-in [`Reflect`] derive macro to automatically handle all the
/// implementation details for you.
/// However, if you _must_ implement this trait manually, there are a few things to keep in mind...
///
/// ## Field Order
///
/// While tuple variants identify their fields by the order in which they are defined, struct
/// variants identify fields by their name.
/// However, both should allow access to fields by their defined order.
///
/// The reason all fields, regardless of variant type, need to be accessible by their order is
/// due to field iteration.
/// We need a way to iterate through each field in a variant, and the easiest way of achieving
/// that is through the use of field order.
///
/// The derive macro adds proper struct variant handling for [`Enum::index_of`], [`Enum::name_at`]
/// and [`Enum::field_at[_mut]`](Enum::field_at) methods.
/// The first two methods are __required__ for all struct variant types.
/// By convention, implementors should also handle the last method as well, but this is not
/// a strict requirement.
///
/// ## Field Names
///
/// Implementors may choose to handle [`Enum::index_of`], [`Enum::name_at`], and
/// [`Enum::field[_mut]`](Enum::field) for tuple variants by considering stringified `usize`s to be
/// valid names (such as `"3"`).
/// This isn't wrong to do, but the convention set by the derive macro is that it isn't supported.
/// It's preferred that these strings be converted to their proper `usize` representations and
/// the [`Enum::field_at[_mut]`](Enum::field_at) methods be used instead.
