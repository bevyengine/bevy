//! Definitions for a few common task pools that we want. Generally the determining factor for what
//! kind of work should go in each pool is latency requirements.
//!
//! For CPU-intensive work (tasks that generally spin until completion) we have a standard Compute
//! pool and an AsyncCompute pool. Work that does not need to be completed to present the next
//! frame should go to the AsyncCompute pool
//!
//! For IO-intensive work (tasks that spend very little time in a "woken" state) we have an IO
//! task pool. The tasks here are expected to complete very quickly. Generally they should just
//! await receiving data from somewhere (i.e. disk) and signal other systems when the data is ready
//! for consumption. (likely via channels)
