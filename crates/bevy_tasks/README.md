# bevy_tasks

This is a simple threadpool with minimal dependencies. The main usecase is a scoped fork-join, i.e. spawning tasks from
a single thread and having that thread await the completion of those tasks. This is intended specifically for 
[`bevy`][bevy] as a lighter alternative to [`rayon`][rayon] for this specific usecase. There are also utilities for
generating the tasks from a slice of data. This library is intended for games and makes no attempt to ensure fairness 
or ordering of spawned tasks.

It is based on [`multitask`][multitask], a lightweight executor that allows the end user to manage their own threads.
`multitask` is based on async-task, a core piece of async-std.
