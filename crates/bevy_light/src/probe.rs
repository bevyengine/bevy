/// A marker component for a light probe, which is a cuboid region that provides
/// global illumination to all fragments inside it.
///
/// Note that a light probe will have no effect unless the entity contains some
/// kind of illumination, which can either be an [`EnvironmentMapLight`] or an
/// `IrradianceVolume`.
///
/// The light probe range is conceptually a unit cube (1×1×1) centered on the
/// origin. The [`Transform`] applied to this entity can scale, rotate, or translate
/// that cube so that it contains all fragments that should take this light probe into account.
///
/// When multiple sources of indirect illumination can be applied to a fragment,
/// the highest-quality one is chosen. Diffuse and specular illumination are
/// considered separately, so, for example, Bevy may decide to sample the
/// diffuse illumination from an irradiance volume and the specular illumination
/// from a reflection probe. From highest priority to lowest priority, the
/// ranking is as follows:
///
/// | Rank | Diffuse              | Specular             |
/// | ---- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
/// | 1    | Lightmap             | Lightmap             |
/// | 2    | Irradiance volume    | Reflection probe     |
/// | 3    | Reflection probe     | View environment map |
/// | 4    | View environment map |                      |
///
/// Note that ambient light is always added to the diffuse component and does
/// not participate in the ranking. That is, ambient light is applied in
/// addition to, not instead of, the light sources above.
///
/// A terminology note: Unfortunately, there is little agreement across game and
/// graphics engines as to what to call the various techniques that Bevy groups
/// under the term *light probe*. In Bevy, a *light probe* is the generic term
/// that encompasses both *reflection probes* and *irradiance volumes*. In
/// object-oriented terms, *light probe* is the superclass, and *reflection
/// probe* and *irradiance volume* are subclasses. In other engines, you may see
/// the term *light probe* refer to an irradiance volume with a single voxel, or
/// perhaps some other technique, while in Bevy *light probe* refers not to a
/// specific technique but rather to a class of techniques. Developers familiar
/// with other engines should be aware of this terminology difference.
