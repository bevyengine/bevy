/// Specifies the range of distances that this entity must be from the camera in
/// order to be rendered.
///
/// This is also known as *hierarchical level of detail* or *HLOD*.
///
/// Use this component when you want to render a high-polygon mesh when the
/// camera is close and a lower-polygon mesh when the camera is far away. This
/// is a common technique for improving performance, because fine details are
/// hard to see in a mesh at a distance. To avoid an artifact known as *popping*
/// between levels, each level has a *margin*, within which the object
/// transitions gradually from invisible to visible using a dithering effect.
///
/// You can also use this feature to replace multiple meshes with a single mesh
/// when the camera is distant. This is the reason for the term "*hierarchical*
/// level of detail". Reducing the number of meshes can be useful for reducing
/// drawcall count. Note that you must place the [`VisibilityRange`] component
/// on each entity you want to be part of a LOD group, as [`VisibilityRange`]
/// isn't automatically propagated down to children.
///
/// A typical use of this feature might look like this:
///
/// | Entity                  | `start_margin` | `end_margin` |
/// |-------------------------|----------------|--------------|
/// | Root                    | N/A            | N/A          |
/// | ├─ High-poly mesh       | [0, 0)         | [20, 25)     |
/// | ├─ Low-poly mesh        | [20, 25)       | [70, 75)     |
/// | └─ Billboard *imposter* | [70, 75)       | [150, 160)   |
///
/// With this setup, the user will see a high-poly mesh when the camera is
/// closer than 20 units. As the camera zooms out, between 20 units to 25 units,
/// the high-poly mesh will gradually fade to a low-poly mesh. When the camera
/// is 70 to 75 units away, the low-poly mesh will fade to a single textured
/// quad. And between 150 and 160 units, the object fades away entirely. Note
/// that the `end_margin` of a higher LOD is always identical to the
/// `start_margin` of the next lower LOD; this is important for the crossfade
/// effect to function properly.
