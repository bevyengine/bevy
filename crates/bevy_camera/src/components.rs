    /// - If set to more than `0`, any opaque [`clear_color`](Camera::clear_color) will obscure the environment
    ///   map light's texture, preventing it from being visible “through” transmissive materials. If you'd like
    ///   to still have the environment map show up in your refractions, you can set the clear color's alpha to `0.0`.
