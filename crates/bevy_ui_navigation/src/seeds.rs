//! [`NavMenu`] builders to convert into [`TreeMenu`].
//!
//! This module defines a bunch of "seed" bundles. Systems in [`crate::named`],
//! and [`crate::resolve`] will take the components
//! defined in those seeds and replace them by [`NavMenu`]s. It is necessary
//! for a few things:
//! * The [`active_child`](TreeMenu::active_child) field of `NavMenu`, which
//!   cannot be inferred without the [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)s children of that menu
//! * Finding the [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) specified in [`ParentName`]
//!
//! # Seed bundles
//!
//! Seed bundles are collections of components that will trigger various
//! pre-processing to create a [`TreeMenu`]. They are a combination of those
//! components:
//! * [`TreeMenuSeed`]: the base seed, which will be converted into a [`TreeMenu`]
//!   in [`crate::resolve::insert_tree_menus`].
//! * [`ParentName`], the *by-name* marker: marks a [`TreeMenuSeed`] as needing
//!   its [`focus_parent`](TreeMenuSeed::focus_parent) to be updated by
//!   [`crate::named::resolve_named_menus`] with the [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) which
//!   [`Name`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.8.0/bevy/core/struct.Name.html) matches
//!   the one in [`ParentName`]. If for whatever reason that update doesn't
//!   happen, [`crate::resolve::insert_tree_menus`] will panic.
//!
//! Those components are combined in the seed bundles. Which processing step is
//! applied to the [`TreeMenuSeed`] depends on which components it was inserted
//! with. The bundles are:
//! * [`MenuSeed`]: Creates a [`NavMenu`].
//! * [`NamedMenuSeed`]: Creates a [`NavMenu`] "reachable from" the
//!   [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) named in the [`ParentName`].
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! In order to correctly create the [`TreeMenu`] specified with the bundles
//! declared int this module, the systems need to be ran in this order:
//!
//! ```text
//! named::resolve_named_menus â†’ resolve::insert_tree_menus
//! ```
//!
//! The resolve_named/insert relationship should be upheld. Otherwise, root
//! NavMenus will spawn instead of NavMenus with parent with given name.

/// A menu that isolate children [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)s from other

///
/// # Usage
///
/// A [`NavMenu`] can be used to:
/// * Prevent navigation from one specific submenu to another
/// * Specify if 2d navigation wraps around the screen, see
///   [`NavMenu::Wrapping2d`].
/// * Specify "scope menus" such that a
///   [`NavRequest::ScopeMove`](crate::NavRequest::ScopeMove) emitted when
///   the focused element is a [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) nested within this `NavMenu`
///   will navigate this menu. See [`NavMenu::BoundScope`] and
///   [`NavMenu::WrappingScope`].
/// * Specify _submenus_ and specify from where those submenus are reachable.
/// * Add a specific component to all [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)s in this menu. You must
///   first create a "seed" bundle with any of the [`NavMenu`] methods and then
///   call [`marking`](MenuSeed::marking) on it.
/// * Specify which entity will be the parents of this [`NavMenu`], see
///   [`NavMenu::reachable_from`] or [`NavMenu::reachable_from_named`] if you don't
///   have access to the [`Entity`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.8.0/bevy/ecs/entity/struct.Entity.html)
///   for the parent [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)
///
/// If you want to specify which [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) should be
/// focused first when entering a menu, you should mark one of the children of
/// this menu with [`Focusable::dormant`](crate::Focusable::dormant).
///
/// ## Example
///
/// See the example in this [crate]'s root level documentation page.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// **You need to follow those rules (invariants) to avoid panics**:
/// 1. A `Menu` must have **at least one** [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) child in the UI
///    hierarchy.
/// 2. There must not be a menu loop. Ie: a way to go from menu A to menu B and
///    then from menu B to menu A while never going back.
/// 3. Focusables in 2d menus must have a `GlobalTransform`.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Thankfully, programming errors are caught early and you'll probably get a
/// panic fairly quickly if you don't follow the invariants.
/// * Invariant (1) panics as soon as you add the menu without focusable
///   children.
/// * Invariant (2) panics if the focus goes into a menu loop.
