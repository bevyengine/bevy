//!
//! In order to correctly create the [`TreeMenu`] specified with the bundles
//! declared int this module, the systems need to be ran in this order:
//!
//! ```text
//! named::resolve_named_menus â†’ resolve::insert_tree_menus
//! ```
//!
//! The `resolve_named/insert` relationship should be upheld. Otherwise, root
//! [`MenuSetting`]s will spawn instead of [`MenuSetting`]s with parent with given name.

//! [`Focusable`]: crate::Focusable

/// A menu that isolate children [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)s from other
/// focusables and specify navigation method within itself.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// A [`MenuSetting`] can be used to:
/// * Prevent navigation from one specific submenu to another
/// * Specify if 2d navigation wraps around the screen, see
///   [`MenuSetting::Wrapping2d`].
/// * Specify "scope menus" such that a
///   [`NavRequest::ScopeMove`](crate::NavRequest::ScopeMove) emitted when
///   the focused element is a [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) nested within this `MenuSetting`
///   will navigate this menu. See [`MenuSetting::BoundScope`] and
///   [`MenuSetting::WrappingScope`].
/// * Specify _submenus_ and specify from where those submenus are reachable.
/// * Add a specific component to all [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)s in this menu. You must
///   first create a "seed" bundle with any of the [`MenuSetting`] methods and then
///   call [`marking`](MenuSeed::marking) on it.
/// * Specify which entity will be the parents of this [`MenuSetting`], see
///   [`MenuSetting::reachable_from`] or [`MenuSetting::reachable_from_named`] if you don't
///   have access to the [`Entity`]
///   for the parent [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable)
///
/// If you want to specify which [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) should be
/// focused first when entering a menu, you should mark one of the children of
/// this menu with [`Focusable::prioritized`](crate::Focusable::prioritized).
///
/// ## Example
///
/// See the example in this [crate]'s root level documentation page.
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// **You need to follow those rules (invariants) to avoid panics**:
/// 1. A `Menu` must have **at least one** [`Focusable`](crate::Focusable) child in the UI
///    hierarchy.
/// 2. There must not be a menu loop. Ie: a way to go from menu A to menu B and
///    then from menu B to menu A while never going back.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Thankfully, programming errors are caught early and you'll probably get a
/// panic fairly quickly if you don't follow the invariants.
/// * Invariant (1) panics as soon as you add the menu without focusable
///   children.
/// * Invariant (2) panics if the focus goes into a menu loop.
