/// the requested size, measured in logical pixels, which is the value submitted
/// to the API when creating the window, or requesting that it be resized.
///
/// The actual size, in logical pixels, of the window may not match the
/// requested size due to operating system limits on the window size, or the
/// quantization of the logical size when converting the physical size to the
/// logical size through the scaling factor.
