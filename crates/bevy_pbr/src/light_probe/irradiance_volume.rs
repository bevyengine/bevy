//! Irradiance volumes, also known as voxel global illumination.
//!
//! An *irradiance volume* is a cuboid voxel region consisting of
//! regularly-spaced precomputed samples of diffuse indirect light. They're
//! ideal if you have a dynamic object such as a character that can move about
//! static non-moving geometry such as a level in a game, and you want that
//! dynamic object to be affected by the light bouncing off that static
//! geometry.
//!
//! To use irradiance volumes, you need to precompute, or *bake*, the indirect
//! light in your scene. Bevy doesn't currently come with a way to do this.
//! Fortunately, [Blender] provides a [baking tool] as part of the Eevee
//! renderer, and its irradiance volumes are compatible with those used by Bevy.
//! The [`bevy-baked-gi`] project provides a tool, `export-blender-gi`, that can
//! extract the baked irradiance volumes from the Blender `.blend` file and
//! package them up into a `.ktx2` texture for use by the engine. See the
//! documentation in the `bevy-baked-gi` project for more details on this
//! workflow.
//!
//! Like all light probes in Bevy, irradiance volumes are 1×1×1 cubes that can
//! be arbitrarily scaled, rotated, and positioned in a scene with the
//! [`bevy_transform::components::Transform`] component. The 3D voxel grid will
//! be stretched to fill the interior of the cube, and the illumination from the
//! irradiance volume will apply to all fragments within that bounding region.
//!
//! Bevy's irradiance volumes are based on Valve's [*ambient cubes*] as used in
//! *Half-Life 2* ([Mitchell 2006, slide 27]). These encode a single color of
//! light from the six 3D cardinal directions and blend the sides together
//! according to the surface normal. For an explanation of why ambient cubes
//! were chosen over spherical harmonics, see [Why ambient cubes?] below.
//!
//! If you wish to use a tool other than `export-blender-gi` to produce the
//! irradiance volumes, you'll need to pack the irradiance volumes in the
//! following format. The irradiance volume of resolution *(Rx, Ry, Rz)* is
//! expected to be a 3D texture of dimensions *(Rx, 2Ry, 3Rz)*. The unnormalized
//! texture coordinate *(s, t, p)* of the voxel at coordinate *(x, y, z)* with
//! side *S* ∈ *{-X, +X, -Y, +Y, -Z, +Z}* is as follows:
//!
//! ```text
//! s = x
//!
//! t = y + ⎰  0 if S ∈ {-X, -Y, -Z}
//!         ⎱ Ry if S ∈ {+X, +Y, +Z}
//!
//!         ⎧   0 if S ∈ {-X, +X}
//! p = z + ⎨  Rz if S ∈ {-Y, +Y}
//!         ⎩ 2Rz if S ∈ {-Z, +Z}
//! ```
//!
//! Visually, in a left-handed coordinate system with Y up, viewed from the
//! right, the 3D texture looks like a stacked series of voxel grids, one for
//! each cube side, in this order:
//!
//! | **+X** | **+Y** | **+Z** |
//! | ------ | ------ | ------ |
//! | **-X** | **-Y** | **-Z** |
//!
//! A terminology note: Other engines may refer to irradiance volumes as *voxel
//! global illumination*, *VXGI*, or simply as *light probes*. Sometimes *light
//! probe* refers to what Bevy calls a reflection probe. In Bevy, *light probe*
//! is a generic term that encompasses all cuboid bounding regions that capture
//! indirect illumination, whether based on voxels or not.
//!
//! Note that, if binding arrays aren't supported (e.g. on WebGPU or WebGL 2),
//! then only the closest irradiance volume to the view will be taken into
//! account during rendering. The required `wgpu` features are
//! [`bevy_render::settings::WgpuFeatures::TEXTURE_BINDING_ARRAY`] and
//! [`bevy_render::settings::WgpuFeatures::SAMPLED_TEXTURE_AND_STORAGE_BUFFER_ARRAY_NON_UNIFORM_INDEXING`].
//!
//! ## Why ambient cubes?
//!
//! This section describes the motivation behind the decision to use ambient
//! cubes in Bevy. It's not needed to use the feature; feel free to skip it
//! unless you're interested in its internal design.
//!
//! Bevy uses *Half-Life 2*-style ambient cubes (usually abbreviated as *HL2*)
//! as the representation of irradiance for light probes instead of the
//! more-popular spherical harmonics (*SH*). This might seem to be a surprising
//! choice, but it turns out to work well for the specific case of voxel
//! sampling on the GPU. Spherical harmonics have two problems that make them
//! less ideal for this use case:
//!
//! 1. The level 1 spherical harmonic coefficients can be negative. That
//! prevents the use of the efficient [RGB9E5 texture format], which only
//! encodes unsigned floating point numbers, and forces the use of the
//! less-efficient [RGBA16F format] if hardware interpolation is desired.
//!
//! 2. As an alternative to RGBA16F, level 1 spherical harmonics can be
//! normalized and scaled to the SH0 base color, as [Frostbite] does. This
//! allows them to be packed in standard LDR RGBA8 textures. However, this
//! prevents the use of hardware trilinear filtering, as the nonuniform scale
//! factor means that hardware interpolation no longer produces correct results.
//! The 8 texture fetches needed to interpolate between voxels can be upwards of
//! twice as slow as the hardware interpolation.
//!
//! The following chart summarizes the costs and benefits of ambient cubes,
//! level 1 spherical harmonics, and level 2 spherical harmonics:
//!
//! | Technique                | HW-interpolated samples | Texel fetches | Bytes per voxel | Quality |
//! | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ------- |
//! | Ambient cubes            |                       3 |             0 |              24 | Medium  |
//! | Level 1 SH, compressed   |                       0 |            36 |              16 | Low     |
//! | Level 1 SH, uncompressed |                       4 |             0 |              24 | Low     |
//! | Level 2 SH, compressed   |                       0 |            72 |              28 | High    |
//! | Level 2 SH, uncompressed |                       9 |             0 |              54 | High    |
//!
//! (Note that the number of bytes per voxel can be reduced using various
//! texture compression methods, but the overall ratios remain similar.)
//!
//! From these data, we can see that ambient cubes balance fast lookups (from
//! leveraging hardware interpolation) with relatively-small storage
//! requirements and acceptable quality. Hence, they were chosen for irradiance
//! volumes in Bevy.
