//! Clustered decals, bounding regions that project textures onto surfaces.
//!
//! A *clustered decal* is a bounding box that projects a texture onto any
//! surface within its bounds along the positive Z axis. In Bevy, clustered
//! decals use the *clustered forward* rendering technique.
//!
//! Clustered decals are the highest-quality types of decals that Bevy supports,
//! but they require bindless textures. This means that they presently can't be
//! used on WebGL 2, WebGPU, macOS, or iOS. Bevy's clustered decals can be used
//! with forward or deferred rendering and don't require a prepass.
//!
//! On their own, clustered decals only project the base color of a texture. You
//! can, however, use the built-in *tag* field to customize the appearance of a
//! clustered decal arbitrarily. See the documentation in `clustered.wgsl` for
//! more information and the `clustered_decals` example for an example of use.
