//! Volumetric fog and volumetric lighting, also known as light shafts or god
//! rays.
//!
//! This module implements a more physically-accurate, but slower, form of fog
//! than the [`crate::fog`] module does. Notably, this *volumetric fog* allows
//! for light beams from directional lights to shine through, creating what is
//! known as *light shafts* or *god rays*.
//!
//! To add volumetric fog to a scene, add [`VolumetricFog`] to the
//! camera, and add [`VolumetricLight`] to directional lights that you wish to
//! be volumetric. [`VolumetricFog`] feature numerous settings that
//! allow you to define the accuracy of the simulation, as well as the look of
//! the fog. Currently, only interaction with directional lights that have
//! shadow maps is supported. Note that the overhead of the effect scales
//! directly with the number of directional lights in use, so apply
//! [`VolumetricLight`] sparingly for the best results.
//!
//! The overall algorithm, which is implemented as a postprocessing effect, is a
//! combination of the techniques described in [Scratchapixel] and [this blog
//! post]. It uses raymarching in screen space, transformed into shadow map
//! space for sampling and combined with physically-based modeling of absorption
//! and scattering. Bevy employs the widely-used [Henyey-Greenstein phase
//! function] to model asymmetry; this essentially allows light shafts to fade
//! into and out of existence as the user views them.
