// which may be as little as 16kB or 64kB. But, we may not need all N.
// We may only need, for example, 10.
//
// If we used uniform buffers ‘normally’ then we would have to write a full
// binding of data for each dynamic offset binding, which is wasteful, makes
// the buffer much larger than it needs to be, and uses more memory bandwidth
// to transfer the data, which then costs frame time So @superdump came up
// with this design: just bind data at the specified offset and interpret
// the data at that offset as an array<T, N> regardless of what is there.
//
// So instead of writing N Mat4s when you only need 10, you write 10, and
// then pad up to the next dynamic offset alignment. Then write the next.
// And for the last dynamic offset binding, make sure there is a full binding
// of data after it so that the buffer is of size
// `last dynamic offset` + `array<mat4x4<f32>>`.
//
// Then when binding the first dynamic offset, the first 10 entries in the array
// are what you expect, but if you read the 11th you’re reading ‘invalid’ data
// which could be padding or could be from the next binding.
//
// In this way, we can pack ‘variable sized arrays’ into uniform buffer bindings
// which normally only support fixed size arrays. You just have to make sure
// in the shader that you only read the values that are valid for that binding.
