/// which will be cloned for each new glTF load. This enables stateful
/// handling of glTF extension data during a single load.
///
/// When loading a glTF file, a glTF object that could contain extension
/// data will cause the relevant hook to execute once per object.
/// Each invocation will receive all extension data, which is required because
/// many extensions require accessing data defined by other extensions.

/// The hooks are always called once, even if there is no extension data
/// This is useful for scenarios where additional extension data isn't
/// required, but processing should still happen.
