/// simulate the human eye's ability to adapt to different lighting conditions.
///
/// Bevy's implementation builds a 64 bin histogram of the scene's luminance,
/// and then adjusts the exposure so that the average brightness of the final
/// render will be middle gray. Because it's using a histogram, some details can
/// be selectively ignored or emphasized. Outliers like shadows and specular
/// highlights can be ignored, and certain areas can be given more (or less)
/// weight based on a mask.
