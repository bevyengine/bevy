///
/// ## Logic
///
/// Every time the user touches the screen, a new [`TouchPhase::Started`] event with an unique
/// identifier for the finger is generated. When the finger is lifted, the [`TouchPhase::Ended`]
/// event is generated with the same finger id.
///
/// After a [`TouchPhase::Started`] event has been emitted, there may be zero or more [`TouchPhase::Moved`]
/// events when the finger is moved or the touch pressure changes.
///
/// The finger id may be reused by the system after an [`TouchPhase::Ended`] event. The user
/// should assume that a new [`TouchPhase::Started`] event received with the same id has nothing
/// to do with the old finger and is a new finger.
///
/// A [`TouchPhase::Cancelled`] event is emitted when the system has canceled tracking this
/// touch, such as when the window loses focus, or on iOS if the user moves the
/// device against their face.
///
