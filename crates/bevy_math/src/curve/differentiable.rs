//! This module holds marker traits for continuous and differentiable curves.
//!
//! These serve as guard rails to prevent using curves for operations that require differentiability
//! where it cannot be guaranteed by construction. On the other hand, these requirements may be
//! circumvented by a blessing procedure which can treat any curve with appropriate data as
//! continuous/differentiable (see [`Blessed`]).
