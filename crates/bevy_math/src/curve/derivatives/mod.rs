//! This module holds traits related to extracting derivatives from curves. In
//! applications, the derivatives of interest are chiefly the first and second;
//! in this module, these are provided by the traits [`CurveWithDerivative`]
//! and [`CurveWithTwoDerivatives`].
//!
//! These take ownership of the curve they are used on by default, so that
//! the resulting output may be used in more durable contexts. For example,
//! `CurveWithDerivative<T>` is not dyn-compatible, but `Curve<WithDerivative<T>>`
//! is, so if such a curve needs to be stored in a dynamic context, calling
//! [`with_derivative`] and then placing the result in a
//! `Box<Curve<WithDerivative<T>>>` is sensible.
//!
//! On the other hand, in more transient contexts, consuming a value merely to
//! sample derivatives is inconvenient, and in these cases, it is recommended
//! to use [`by_ref`] when possible to create a referential curve first, retaining
//! liveness of the original.
//!
//! This module also holds the [`SampleDerivative`] and [`SampleTwoDerivatives`]
//! traits, which can be used to easily implement `CurveWithDerivative` and its
//! counterpart.
//!
//! [`with_derivative`]: CurveWithDerivative::with_derivative
//! [`by_ref`]: crate::curve::CurveExt::by_ref
