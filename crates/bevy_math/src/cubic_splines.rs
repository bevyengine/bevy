/// A spline composed of a single cubic Bezier curve.
///
/// Useful for user-drawn curves with local control, or animation easing. See
/// [`CubicSegment::new_bezier`] for use in easing.
///
/// ### Interpolation
/// The curve only passes through the first and last control point in each set of four points. The curve
/// is divided into "segments" by every fourth control point.
///
/// ### Tangency
/// Tangents are manually defined by the two intermediate control points within each set of four points.
/// You can think of the control points the curve passes through as "anchors", and as the intermediate
/// control points as the anchors displaced along their tangent vectors
///
/// ### Continuity
/// A Bezier curve is at minimum C0 continuous, meaning it has no holes or jumps. Each curve segment is
/// C2, meaning the tangent vector changes smoothly between each set of four control points, but this
/// doesn't hold at the control points between segments. Making the whole curve C1 or C2 requires moving
/// the intermediate control points to align the tangent vectors between segments, and can result in a
/// loss of local control.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_math::{*, prelude::*};
/// let points = [[
///     vec2(-1.0, -20.0),
///     vec2(3.0, 2.0),
///     vec2(5.0, 3.0),

///
/// ### Tangency
/// Tangents are automatically computed based on the position of control points.
///
/// ### Continuity
/// When there is no knot multiplicity, the curve is C2 continuous, meaning it has no holes or jumps and the
/// tangent vector changes smoothly along the entire curve length. Like the [`CubicBSpline`], the acceleration
/// continuity makes it useful for camera paths. Knot multiplicity of 2 in intermediate knots reduces the
/// continuity to C1, and knot multiplicity of 3 reduces the continuity to C0. The curve is always at least
/// C0, meaning it has no jumps or holes.
///
/// ### Usage
///
