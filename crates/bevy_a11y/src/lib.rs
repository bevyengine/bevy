//! Reusable accessibility primitives
//!
//! This crate provides accessibility integration for the engine. It exposes the
//! [`AccessibilityPlugin`]. This plugin integrates `AccessKit`, a Rust crate
//! providing OS-agnostic accessibility primitives, with Bevy's ECS.
//!
//! ## Some notes on utility
//!
//! While this crate defines useful types for accessibility, it does not
//! actually power accessibility features in Bevy.
//!
//! Instead, it helps other interfaces coordinate their approach to
//! accessibility. Binary authors should add the [`AccessibilityPlugin`], while
//! library maintainers may use the [`AccessibilityRequested`] and
//! [`ManageAccessibilityUpdates`] resources.
//!
//! The [`AccessibilityNode`] component is useful in both cases. It helps
//! describe an entity in terms of its accessibility factors through an
//! `AccessKit` "node".
//!
//! Typical UI concepts, like buttons, checkboxes, and textboxes, are easily
//! described by this component, though, technically, it can represent any kind
//! of Bevy [`Entity`].
//!
//! ## This crate no longer re-exports `AccessKit`
//!
//! As of Bevy version 0.15, [the `accesskit` crate][accesskit_crate] is no
//! longer re-exported from this crate.[^accesskit_node_confusion] If you need
//! to use `AccessKit` yourself, you'll have to add it as a separate dependency
//! in your project's `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! Make sure to use the same version of the `accesskit` crate as Bevy.
//! Otherwise, you may experience errors similar to: "Perhaps two different
//! versions of crate `accesskit` are being used?"
//!
//! [accesskit_crate]: https://crates.io/crates/accesskit
//! [`Entity`]: bevy_ecs::entity::Entity
//!
//! <!--
//! note: multi-line footnotes need to be indented like this!
//!
//! please do not remove the indentation, or the second paragraph will display
//! at the end of the module docs, **before** the footnotes...
//! -->
//!
//! [^accesskit_node_confusion]: Some users were confused about `AccessKit`'s
//!  `Node` type, sometimes thinking it was Bevy UI's primary way to define
//!  nodes!
//!
//!     For this reason, its re-export was removed by default. Users who need
//!     its types can instead manually depend on the `accesskit` crate.

/// component, then `E`'s `AccessKit` node will be a child of `P`'s `AccessKit`
/// node.

/// - P
///     - E
///
/// In other words, parent-child relationships are maintained, but only if both
/// have this component.
///
/// ### On the Window
///
/// If `E` doesn't have a parent, or if the immediate parent doesn't have an
/// `AccessibilityNode`, its `AccessKit` node will be an immediate child of the
/// primary window.
///
/// Resulting `AccessKit` tree:
/// - Primary window
///     - E
///
/// When there's no `AccessKit`-compatible parent, the child lacks hierarchical
/// information in `AccessKit`. As such, it is placed directly under the
/// primary window on the `AccessKit` tree.
