  |          cannot move out of here
  |          move occurs because value has type `A`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

  = note: this error originates in the macro `bevy_ecs::ptr::deconstruct_moving_ptr` which comes from the expansion of the derive macro `Bundle` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
