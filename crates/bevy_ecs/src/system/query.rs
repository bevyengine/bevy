/// Provides scoped access to a [`World`] according to a given [`WorldQuery`] and query filter.
///
/// Queries are a powerful tool enabling the programmer to iterate over entities and their components
/// as well as filtering them on certain conditions.
///
/// # Query Building Primer
///
/// ### Basic Component Access
///
/// A basic query looks like `Query<&UnitHealth>` and all it does is grant immutable access to all
/// `UnitHealth` components. Similarly using `&mut UnitHealth` instead grants mutable access instead.
///
/// The main way to access the components of a query is through the [`Query::iter`] and [`Query::iter_mut`]
/// functions which return a [`QueryIter`] to iterate over:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem;
/// # use bevy_ecs::system::Query;
/// struct UnitHealth(pub u32);
/// fn system(query: Query<&UnitHealth>) {
///     for UnitHealth(health) in query.iter() {
///         println!("We got {} health points left!", health);
///     }
/// }
/// # system.system();
/// ```
///
/// ### Multiple Component Access
///
/// Instead of asking for just one component like before we can build a query that queries for multiple
/// components with the help of tuples,`Query<(&Shape, &Color, &mut Size)>`. This query retrieves
/// immutable references to the `Shape` and `Color` component and a mutable reference to the `Size`
/// component.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem;
/// # use bevy_ecs::system::Query;
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// enum Shape {
///     Circle,
///     Box,
/// };
/// struct Color(pub String);
/// struct Size(pub u32);
/// fn system(mut query: Query<(&Shape, &Color, &mut Size)>) {
///     for (shape, color, mut size) in query.iter_mut() {
///         *size = Size(1);
///         println!("We got a {} colored {:?} and made it one unit big!", color.0, shape);
///     }
/// }
/// # system.system();
/// ```
///
/// Note the use of [`Query::iter_mut`] here, as our query is not read-only anymore due to the use
/// of the `&mut` [`WorldQuery`] we aren't able to use the `iter` method any longer.
///
/// ### Filtering Query Results
///
/// Queries also support filters. A filter is a [`WorldQuery`] that can be used as a predicate to
/// filter out entities that do not meet the requirement set by the predicate. [`With`](crate::query::With)
/// is one such filter and all it does is filter out all entities that do not contain the component
/// it requests. Let's look at an example on how to use this filter.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::system::IntoSystem;
/// # use bevy_ecs::system::Query;
/// # use bevy_ecs::query::With;
/// struct Person(String);
/// struct IsTallEnough;
/// fn system(query: Query<&Person, With<IsTallEnough>>) {
///     for person in query.iter() {
///         println!("{} is tall enough!", person.0);
///     }
/// }
/// # system.system();
/// ```
///
/// As shown above, the filter is a second type parameter of the query. It is optional (defaults to
/// ()). Filters do not give access to the component data, only limit the entities that the query will match.
///
/// ### Optional Components
///
/// Now we've seen how to narrow down results of a query, but what if we want to act on entities that
/// may have a component but not always. This is where [`Option`] comes into play, with `Option` we
/// can specify just that. The result of the following query, `Query<&Color, Option<&mut Size>>`, is
/// the tuple `(&Color, Option<&mut Size>)` containing all entities that have the `Color` component,
/// some of which also have a `Size` component. Note that we didn't put a [`Component`] inside the
/// `Option` but a [`WorldQuery`], `&mut T` in this case. This means we can also do the following
/// just fine, `Query<Option<(&Size, &Color)>>`.
///
/// Do take care when handling optional components though, as iterating a query that solely consists
/// of optional components will go over all the entities of the [`World`]. Therefore it's best to
/// design your queries in such a way that they at least contain one non-optional [`WorldQuery`].
///
/// This touches all the basics of queries, make sure to check out all the [`WorldQueries`](WorldQuery)
/// bevy has to offer.
