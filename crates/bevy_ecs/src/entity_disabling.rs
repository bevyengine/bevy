//! Disabled entities do not show up in queries unless the query explicitly mentions them.
//!
//! Entities which are disabled in this way are not removed from the [`World`],
//! and their relationships remain intact.
//! In many cases, you may want to disable entire trees of entities at once,
//! using [`EntityCommands::insert_recursive`](crate::prelude::EntityCommands::insert_recursive).
//!
//! While Bevy ships with a built-in [`Disabled`] component, you can also create your own
//! disabling components, which will operate in the same way but can have distinct semantics.
//!
//! ```
//! use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Our custom disabling component!
//! #[derive(Component, Clone)]
//! struct Prefab;
//!
//! #[derive(Component)]
//! struct A;
//!
//! let mut world = World::new();
//! world.register_disabling_component::<Prefab>();
//! world.spawn((A, Prefab));
//! world.spawn((A,));
//! world.spawn((A,));
//!
//! let mut normal_query = world.query::<&A>();
//! assert_eq!(2, normal_query.iter(&world).count());
//!
//! let mut prefab_query = world.query_filtered::<&A, With<Prefab>>();
//! assert_eq!(1, prefab_query.iter(&world).count());
//!
//! let mut maybe_prefab_query = world.query::<(&A, Has<Prefab>)>();
//! assert_eq!(3, maybe_prefab_query.iter(&world).count());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Default query filters
//!
//! In Bevy, entity disabling is implemented through the construction of a global "default query filter".
//! Queries which do not explicitly mention the disabled component will not include entities with that component.
//! If an entity has multiple disabling components, it will only be included in queries that mention all of them.
//!
//! For example, `Query<&Position>` will not include entities with the [`Disabled`] component,
//! even if they have a `Position` component,
//! but `Query<&Position, With<Disabled>>` or `Query<(&Position, Has<Disabled>)>` will see them.
//!
//! Entities with disabling components are still present in the [`World`] and can be accessed directly,
//! using methods on [`World`] or [`Commands`](crate::prelude::Commands).
//!
//! ### Warnings
//!
//! Currently, only queries for which the cache is built after enabling a default query filter will have entities
//! with those components filtered. As a result, they should generally only be modified before the
//! app starts.
//!
//! Because filters are applied to all queries they can have performance implication for
//! the enire [`World`], especially when they cause queries to mix sparse and table components.
//! See [`Query` performance] for more info.
//!
//! Custom disabling components can cause significant interoperability issues within the ecosystem,
//! as users must be aware of each disabling component in use.
//! Libraries should think carefully about whether they need to use a new disabling component,
//! and clearly communicate their presence to their users to avoid the new for library compatibility flags.
//!

//! [`Has`]: crate::prelude::Has
