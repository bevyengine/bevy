/// Variant of the [`World`] where resource and component accesses take `&self`, and the responsibility to avoid
/// aliasing violations are given to the caller instead of being checked at compile-time by rust's unique XOR shared rule.
///
/// ### Rationale
/// In rust, having a `&mut World` means that there are absolutely no other references to the safe world alive at the same time,
/// without exceptions. Not even unsafe code can change this.
///
/// But there are situations where careful shared mutable access through a type is possible and safe. For this, rust provides the [`UnsafeCell`](std::cell::UnsafeCell)
/// escape hatch, which allows you to get a `*mut T` from a `&UnsafeCell<T>` and around which safe abstractions can be built.
///
/// Access to resources and components can be done uniquely using [`World::resource_mut`] and [`World::entity_mut`], and shared using [`World::resource`] and [`World::entity`].
/// These methods use lifetimes to check at compile time that no aliasing rules are being broken.
///
/// This alone is not enough to implement bevy systems where multiple systems can access *disjoint* parts of the world concurrently. For this, bevy stores all values of
/// resources and components (and [`ComponentTicks`](crate::component::ComponentTicks)) in [`UnsafeCell`](std::cell::UnsafeCell)s, and carefully validates disjoint access patterns using
/// APIs like [`System::component_access`](crate::system::System::component_access).
///
/// A system then can be executed using [`System::run_unsafe`](crate::system::System::run_unsafe) with a `&World` and use methods with interior mutability to access resource values.
/// access resource values.
///
/// ### Example Usage
///
/// [`UnsafeWorldCell`] can be used as a building block for writing APIs that safely allow disjoint access into the world.
/// In the following example, the world is split into a resource access half and a component access half, where each one can
/// safely hand out mutable references.
