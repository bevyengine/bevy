//! Storage layouts for ECS data.
//!
//! This module implements the low-level collections that store data in a [`World`]. These all offer minimal and often
//! unsafe APIs, and have been made `pub` primarily for debugging and monitoring purposes.
//!
//! # Fetching Storages
//! Each of the below data stores can be fetched via [`Storages`], which can be fetched from a
//! [`World`] via [`World::storages`]. It exposes a top level container for each class of storage within
//! ECS:
//!
//!  - [`Tables`] - columnar contiguous blocks of memory, optimized for fast iteration.
//!  - [`SparseSets`] - sparse `HashMap`-like mappings from entities to components, optimized for random
//!    lookup and regular insertion/removal of components.
//!  - [`Resources`] - singleton storage for the resources in the world
//!
//! # Safety
//! To avoid trivially unsound use of the APIs in this module, it is explicitly impossible to get a mutable
//! reference to [`Storages`] from [`World`], and none of the types publicly expose a mutable interface.
//!
//! [`World`]: crate::world::World
//! [`World::storages`]: crate::world::World::storages
