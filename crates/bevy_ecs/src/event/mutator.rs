/// Mutably reads events of type `T` keeping track of which events have already been read
/// by each system allowing multiple systems to read the same events. Ideal for chains of systems
/// that all want to modify the same events.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// `EventMutators`s are usually declared as a [`SystemParam`].
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Event, Debug)]
/// pub struct MyEvent(pub u32); // Custom event type.
/// fn my_system(mut reader: EventMutator<MyEvent>) {
///     for event in reader.read() {
///         event.0 += 1;
///         println!("received event: {:?}", event);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Concurrency
///
/// Multiple systems with `EventMutator<T>` of the same event type can not run concurrently.
/// They also can not be executed in parallel with [`EventReader`] or [`EventWriter`].
///
/// # Clearing, Reading, and Peeking
///
/// Events are stored in a double buffered queue that switches each frame. This switch also clears the previous
/// frame's events. Events should be read each frame otherwise they may be lost. For manual control over this
/// behavior, see [`Events`].
///
/// Most of the time systems will want to use [`EventMutator::read()`]. This function creates an iterator over
/// all events that haven't been read yet by this system, marking the event as read in the process.
