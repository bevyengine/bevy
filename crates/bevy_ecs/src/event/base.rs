/// Something that "happens" and can be processed by app logic.
///
/// Events can be triggered on a [`World`] using a method like [`trigger`](World::trigger),
/// causing any global [`Observer`] watching that event to run. This allows for push-based
/// event handling where observers are immediately notified of events as they happen.
///
/// Additional event handling behavior can be enabled by implementing the [`EntityEvent`]
/// and [`BufferedEvent`] traits:
///
/// - [`EntityEvent`]s support targeting specific entities, triggering any observers watching those targets.
///   They are useful for entity-specific event handlers and can even be propagated from one entity to another.
/// - [`BufferedEvent`]s support a pull-based event handling system where events are written using an [`EventWriter`]
///   and read later using an [`EventReader`]. This is an alternative to observers that allows efficient batch processing
///   of events at fixed points in a schedule.
///
/// Events must be thread-safe.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// The [`Event`] trait can be derived:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
/// #
/// #[derive(Event)]
/// struct Speak {
///     message: String,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// An [`Observer`] can then be added to listen for this event type:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # #[derive(Event)]
/// # struct Speak {
/// #     message: String,
/// # }
/// #
/// # let mut world = World::new();
/// #
/// world.add_observer(|trigger: On<Speak>| {
///     println!("{}", trigger.message);
/// });
/// ```
///
/// The event can be triggered on the [`World`] using the [`trigger`](World::trigger) method:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # #[derive(Event)]
/// # struct Speak {
/// #     message: String,
/// # }
/// #
/// # let mut world = World::new();
/// #
/// # world.add_observer(|trigger: On<Speak>| {
/// #     println!("{}", trigger.message);
/// # });
/// #
/// # world.flush();
/// #
/// world.trigger(Speak {
///     message: "Hello!".to_string(),
/// });
/// ```

/// [`EntityEvent`] or [`BufferedEvent`], respectively.
