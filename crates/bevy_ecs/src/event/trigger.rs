/// be executed in.
///
/// Implementing [`Trigger`] is "advanced-level" territory, and is generally unnecessary unless you are developing highly specialized
/// [`Event`] trigger logic.
///
/// Bevy comes with a number of built-in [`Trigger`] implementations (see their documentation for more info):
/// - [`GlobalTrigger`]: The [`Event`] derive defaults to using this
/// - [`EntityTrigger`]: The [`EntityEvent`] derive defaults to using this
/// - [`PropagateEntityTrigger`]: The [`EntityEvent`] derive uses this when propagation is enabled.
/// - [`EntityComponentsTrigger`]: Used by Bevy's [component lifecycle events](crate::lifecycle).
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementing this properly is _advanced_ soundness territory! Implementers must abide by the following:
///
/// - The `E`' [`Event::Trigger`] must be constrained to the implemented [`Trigger`] type, as part of the implementation.
///   This prevents other [`Trigger`] implementations from directly deferring to your implementation, which is a very easy
///   soundness misstep, as most [`Trigger`] implementations will invoke observers that are developed _for their specific [`Trigger`] type_.
///   Without this constraint, something like [`GlobalTrigger`] could be called for _any_ [`Event`] type, even one that expects a different
///   [`Trigger`] type. This would result in an unsound cast of [`GlobalTrigger`] reference.
///   This is not expressed as an explicit type constraint,, as the `for<'a> Event::Trigger<'a>` lifetime can mismatch explicit lifetimes in
///   some impls.
