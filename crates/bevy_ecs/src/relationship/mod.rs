/// A [`Component`] on a "source" [`Entity`] that references another target [`Entity`], creating a "relationship" between them. Every [`Relationship`]
/// has a corresponding [`RelationshipTarget`] type (and vice-versa), which exists on the "target" entity of a relationship and contains the list of all
/// "source" entities that relate to the given "target"
///
/// The [`Relationship`] component is the "source of truth" and the [`RelationshipTarget`] component reflects that source of truth. When a [`Relationship`]
/// component is inserted on an [`Entity`], the corresponding [`RelationshipTarget`] component is immediately inserted on the target component if it does
/// not already exist, and the "source" entity is automatically added to the [`RelationshipTarget`] collection (this is done via "component hooks").
///
/// A common example of a [`Relationship`] is the parent / child relationship. Bevy ECS includes a canonical form of this via the [`ChildOf`](crate::hierarchy::ChildOf)
/// [`Relationship`] and the [`Children`](crate::hierarchy::Children) [`RelationshipTarget`].
///
/// [`Relationship`] and [`RelationshipTarget`] should always be derived via the [`Component`] trait to ensure the hooks are set up properly.
