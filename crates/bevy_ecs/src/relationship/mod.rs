/// has a corresponding [`RelationshipSources`] type (and vice-versa), which exists on the "target" entity of a relationship and contains the list of all
/// "source" entities that relate to the given "target"
///
/// The [`Relationship`] component is the "source of truth" and the [`RelationshipSources`] component reflects that source of truth. When a [`Relationship`]
/// component is inserted on an [`Entity`], the corresponding [`RelationshipSources`] component is immediately inserted on the target component if it does
/// not already exist, and the "source" entity is automatically added to the [`RelationshipSources`] collection (this is done via "component hooks").
///
/// A common example of a [`Relationship`] is the parent / child relationship. Bevy ECS includes a canonical form of this via the [`Parent`](crate::hierarchy::Parent)
/// [`Relationship`] and the [`Children`](crate::hierarchy::Children) [`RelationshipSources`].
///
/// [`Relationship`] and [`RelationshipSources`] should always be derived to ensure the hooks are set up properly. They will both automatically
/// implement [`Component`] with the necessary configuration to drive the [`Relationship`].
