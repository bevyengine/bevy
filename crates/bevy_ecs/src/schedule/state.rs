/// Types that can define world-wide states in a finite-state machine.
///
/// The [`Default`] trait defines the starting state.
/// Multiple states can be defined for the same world,
/// allowing you to classify the state of the world across orthogonal dimensions.
/// You can access the current state of type `T` with the [`State<T>`] resource,
/// and the queued state with the [`NextState<T>`] resource.
///
/// State transitions typically occur in the [`OnEnter<T::Variant>`] and [`OnExit<T:Varaitn>`] schedules,
/// which can be run via the [`apply_state_transition::<T>`] system.
/// Systems that run each frame in various states are typically stored in the main schedule,
/// and are conventionally part of the [`OnUpdate(T::Variant)`] system set.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use bevy_ecs::prelude::States;

/// #[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Debug, Default, States)]
/// enum GameState {
///  #[default]
///   MainMenu,
///   SettingsMenu,
