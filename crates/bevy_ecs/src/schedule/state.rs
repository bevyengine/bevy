/// The [`Default`] trait defines the starting state.

/// and the queued state with the [`NextState<T>`] resource.
///
/// State transitions typically occur in the [`OnEnter<T::Variant>`] and [`OnExit<T:Variant>`] schedules,
/// which can be run via the [`apply_state_transition::<T>`] system.

/// ```rust
