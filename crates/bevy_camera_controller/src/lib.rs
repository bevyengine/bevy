//! A home for first-party camera controllers for Bevy,
//! used for moving the camera around your scene.
//!
//! This crate serves two key purposes:
//!
//! 1. It provides functional camera controllers to help users quickly get started.
//! 2. It holds the camera controllers used by Bevy's own examples and tooling.
//!  
//! While these camera controllers are customizable,
//! there is a limit to the customization options available.
//! If you find your project requires different behavior,
//! do not hesitate to copy-paste the camera controller code
//! into your own project and modify it as needed.
//!
//! Each of the provided controllers is gated behind a feature flag,
//! so you don't have to pay for unused camera controllers.
//! These features are all off by default; to enable them,
//! you need to specify the desired features in your Cargo.toml file.
//!
//! For example, to enable the `free_cam` camera controller,
//! you would add the following to your Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! bevy = { version = "0.X", features = ["free_cam"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Once the correct feature is enabled,
//! add the camera controller plugin to your Bevy app.
//! If your camera is for debugging and development purposes,
//! consider adding a feature flag (e.g. `dev-mode`) or a run condition on
//! the systems in the plugin, which can check a configuration resource.
//!
//! For a full overview of the available camera controllers,
//! please check out the modules of this crate.
//! Each camera controller is stored in its own module,
//! and gated behind a feature flag of the same name.
