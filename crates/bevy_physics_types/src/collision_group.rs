//! Collision group filtering for coarse-grained collision management.
//!
//! [`CollisionGroup`] defines collision groups for efficient broad-phase filtering.
//! When a collision occurs between two entities with groups assigned, they collide
//! unless the group pair is explicitly filtered.
//!
//! ## Basic Filtering
//!
//! Colliders not in any group collide with all other colliders in the scene
//! (except those with disabled collision by default). Groups define which
//! entity categories should not interact.
//!
//! ## Inverted Filtering
//!
//! The [`InvertFilteredGroups`] marker inverts the filter behavior: instead of
//! disabling collisions with listed groups, it disables collisions against
//! **all other colliders except** those in the filtered groups.
//!
//! This is useful for configuring entities that should only interact with
//! specific categories (e.g., a trigger volume that only detects players).
//!
//! ## Group Merging
//!
//! When composing a scene from multiple sources, collision groups may need to
//! be merged. The [`MergeGroupName`] component allows groups with matching names
//! to be combined:
//!
//! - Members of merged groups become members of the unified group
//! - Filter relationships are unioned
//!
//! This is useful when multiple character instances each have ragdoll groups
//! that should filter against each other's controllers.
//!
//! ## Merge Semantics with Inverted Groups
//!
//! **Caution**: Merging groups with different [`InvertFilteredGroups`] settings
//! can have unexpected results. Merging should only ever cause collision pairs
//! to become disabled—a filter cannot re-enable a pair disabled by another group.
//!
//! Example: An inverted group referencing only GroupX (collides only with GroupX)
//! merged with a non-inverting group referencing GroupX (doesn't collide with GroupX)
//! results in a group that collides with nothing.
//!
//! ## Precedence
//!
//! Group filtering is overridden by [`FilteredPairs`](crate::filtered_pairs::FilteredPairs)
//! for fine-grained pairwise exceptions.
