        If your bug is rendering-related, copy the adapter info that appears when you run Bevy.
      
        You should also consider testing the examples of our upstream dependencies to help isolate any setup-specific issue:

        - [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) for rendering problems
        - [`winit`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) for input and window management
        - [`gilrs`](https://docs.rs/gilrs/latest/gilrs/) for gamepad inputs
