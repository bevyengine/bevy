  ISSUE_TITLE: Main branch fails to compile on Rust beta.

# The jobs listed here are intentionally skipped when running on forks, for a number of reasons:
#
# * Scheduled workflows run on the base/default branch, with no way (currently) to change this. On
#   forks, the base/default branch is usually kept in sync with the main Bevy repository, meaning
#   that running this workflow on forks would just be a waste of resources.
#
# * Even if there was a way to change the branch that a scheduled workflow runs on, forks default
#   to not having an issue tracker.
#
# * Even in the event that a fork's issue tracker is enabled, most users probably don't want to
#   receive automated issues in the event of a compilation failure.
#
# Because of these reasons, this workflow is irrelevant for 99% of forks. Thus, the jobs here will
# be skipped when running on any repository that isn't the main Bevy repository.
