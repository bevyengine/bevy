## Showcase

> This section is optional. If this PR does not include a visual change or does not add a new feature, you can delete this section.

- Help others understand the result of this PR by showcasing your awesome work!
- If this PR adds a new feature or public API, consider adding a brief pseudo-code snippet of it in action
- If this PR includes a visual change, consider adding a screenshot, GIF, or video
  - If you want, you could even include a before/after comparison!
- If the Migration Guide adequately covers the changes, you can delete this section

While a showcase should aim to be brief and digestible, you can use a toggleable section to save space on longer showcases:

<details>
  <summary>Click to view showcase</summary>

```rust
println!("My super cool code.");
```

</details>

## Migration Guide

> This section is optional. If there are no breaking changes, you can delete this section.

- If this PR is a breaking change (relative to the last release of Bevy), describe how a user might need to migrate their code to support these changes
- Simply adding new functionality is not a breaking change.
- Fixing behavior that was definitely a bug, rather than a questionable design choice is not a breaking change.
