## Changelog

> This section is optional. If this was a trivial fix, or has no externally-visible impact, you can delete this section.

- What changed as a result of this PR?
- If applicable, organize changes under "Added", "Changed", or "Fixed" sub-headings
- Stick to one or two sentences. If more detail is needed for a particular change, consider adding it to the "Solution" section
  - If you can't summarize the work, your change may be unreasonably large / unrelated. Consider splitting your PR to make it easier to review and merge!

## Migration Guide

> This section is optional. If there are no breaking changes, you can delete this section.

- If this PR is a breaking change (relative to the last release of Bevy), describe how a user might need to migrate their code to support these changes
- Simply adding new functionality is not a breaking change.
- Fixing behavior that was definitely a bug, rather than a questionable design choice is not a breaking change.
