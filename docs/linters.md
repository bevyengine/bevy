# Linters in this Repository

## Code Format Linting with [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)

Can be automatically validated with [`cargo run -p ci`](../tools/ci) (which also runs other checks). Running this command will actually format the code:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

## Code Linting with [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)

Can be automatically run with [`cargo run -p ci`](../tools/ci) (which also runs other checks) or manually with this command:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Explanation:

- `-D warnings`: No warnings are allowed in the codebase.
