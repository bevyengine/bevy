## Cargo Features

Bevy exposes many Cargo features to customize the engine. Enabling them adds functionality but may come at the cost of longer compilation times
and extra dependencies.

### Profiles

"Profiles" are high-level groups of cargo features that provide the full Bevy experience, but scoped to a specific domain.
These exist to be paired with `default-features = false`, enabling compiling only the subset of Bevy that you need.
This can cut down compile times and shrink your final binary size.

For example, you can compile only the "2D" Bevy features (without the 3D features) like this:

```toml
bevy = { version = "0.17", default-features = false, features = ["2d"] }
```

|Profile|Description|
|-|-|
|default|The full default Bevy experience. This is a combination of the following profiles: 2d, 3d, ui|
|2d|The default 2D Bevy experience. This includes the core Bevy framework, 2D functionality, Bevy UI, scenes, audio, and picking.|
|3d|The default 3D Bevy experience. This includes the core Bevy framework, 3D functionality, Bevy UI, scenes, audio, and picking.|
|ui|The default Bevy UI experience.  This includes the core Bevy framework, Bevy UI, scenes, audio, and picking.|

By default, the `bevy` crate enables the  features.

### Collections

"Collections" are mid-level groups of cargo features. These are used to compose the high-level "profiles". If the default profiles don'templated
suit your use case (ex: you want to use a custom renderer, you want to build a "headless" app, you want to target no_std, etc), then you can use these
collections to build your own "profile" equivalent, without needing to manually manage _every single_ feature.

|Collection|Description|
|-|-|
|dev|Enable this feature during development to improve the development experience. This adds features like asset hot-reloading and debugging tools. This should not be enabled for published apps!|
|audio|Features used to build audio Bevy apps.|
|scene|Features used to compose Bevy scenes.|
|picking|Enables picking functionality|
|default_app|The core pieces that most apps need. This serves as a baseline feature set for other higher level feature collections (such as "2d" and "3d"). It is also useful as a baseline feature set for scenarios like headless apps that require no rendering (ex: command line tools, servers, etc).|
|default_platform|These are platform support features, such as OS support/features, windowing and input backends, etc.|
|common_api|Default scene definition features. Note that this does not include an actual renderer, such as bevy_render (Bevy's default render backend).|
|2d_api|Features used to build 2D Bevy apps (does not include a render backend). You generally don't need to worry about this unless you are using a custom renderer.|
|2d_bevy_render|Bevy's built-in 2D renderer, built on top of `bevy_render` |
|3d_api|Features used to build 3D Bevy apps (does not include a render backend). You generally don't need to worry about this unless you are using a custom renderer.|
|3d_bevy_render|Bevy's built-in 3D renderer, built on top of `bevy_render` |
|ui_api|Features used to build UI Bevy apps (does not include a render backend). You generally don't need to worry about this unless you are using a custom renderer.|
|ui_bevy_render|Bevy's built-in UI renderer, built on top of `bevy_render` |
|default_no_std|Recommended defaults for no_std applications|
