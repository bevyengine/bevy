    remove the image loaded check for nodes without images in extract_uinodes  (#7280)
    
    ## Problem
    
    `extract_uinodes` checks if an image is loaded for nodes without images
    
    ## Solution
    
    Move the image loading skip check so that it is only performed for nodes with a `UiImage` component.

    Pipelined Rendering (#6503)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Implement pipelined rendering
    - Fixes #5082
    - Fixes #4718
    
    ## User Facing Description
    
    Bevy now implements piplelined rendering! Pipelined rendering allows the app logic and rendering logic to run on different threads leading to large gains in performance.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2180432/202049871-3c00b801-58ab-448f-93fd-471e30aba55f.png)
    *tracy capture of many_foxes example*
    
    To use pipelined rendering, you just need to add the `PipelinedRenderingPlugin`. If you're using `DefaultPlugins` then it will automatically be added for you on all platforms except wasm. Bevy does not currently support multithreading on wasm which is needed for this feature to work. If you aren't using `DefaultPlugins` you can add the plugin manually.
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    use bevy::render::pipelined_rendering::PipelinedRenderingPlugin;
    
    fn main() {
        App::new()
            // whatever other plugins you need
            .add_plugin(RenderPlugin)
            // needs to be added after RenderPlugin
            .add_plugin(PipelinedRenderingPlugin)
            .run();
    }
    ```
    
    If for some reason pipelined rendering needs to be removed. You can also disable the plugin the normal way.
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    use bevy::render::pipelined_rendering::PipelinedRenderingPlugin;
    
    fn main() {
        App::new.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.build().disable::<PipelinedRenderingPlugin>());
    }
    ```
    
    ### A setup function was added to plugins
    
    A optional plugin lifecycle function was added to the `Plugin trait`. This function is called after all plugins have been built, but before the app runner is called. This allows for some final setup to be done. In the case of pipelined rendering, the function removes the sub app from the main app and sends it to the render thread.
    
    ```rust
    struct MyPlugin;
    impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
        fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
    
        }
    
        // optional function
        fn setup(&self, app: &mut App) {
            // do some final setup before runner is called
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ### A Stage for Frame Pacing
    
    In the `RenderExtractApp` there is a stage labelled `BeforeIoAfterRenderStart` that systems can be added to.  The specific use case for this stage is for a frame pacing system that can delay the start of main app processing in render bound apps to reduce input latency i.e. "frame pacing". This is not currently built into bevy, but exists as `bevy`
    
    ```text
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |         | BeforeIoAfterRenderStart | winit events | main schedule |
    | extract |---------------------------------------------------------|
    |         | extract commands | rendering schedule                   |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    ```
    
    ### Small API additions
    
    * `Schedule::remove_stage`
    * `App::insert_sub_app`
    * `App::remove_sub_app`
    * `TaskPool::scope_with_executor`
    
    ## Problems and Solutions
    
    ### Moving render app to another thread
    
    Most of the hard bits for this were done with the render redo. This PR just sends the render app back and forth through channels which seems to work ok. I originally experimented with using a scope to run the render task. It was cuter, but that approach didn't allow render to start before i/o processing. So I switched to using channels. There is much complexity in the coordination that needs to be done, but it's worth it. By moving rendering during i/o processing the frame times should be much more consistent in render bound apps. See https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4691.
    
    ### Unsoundness with Sending World with NonSend resources
    
    Dropping !Send things on threads other than the thread they were spawned on is considered unsound. The render world doesn't have any nonsend resources. So if we tell the users to "pretty please don't spawn nonsend resource on the render world", we can avoid this problem.
    
    More seriously there is this https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6534 pr, which patches the unsoundness by aborting the app if a nonsend resource is dropped on the wrong thread. ~~That PR should probably be merged before this one.~~ For a longer term solution we have this discussion going https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/6552.
    
    ### NonSend Systems in render world
    
    The render world doesn't have any !Send resources, but it does have a non send system. While Window is Send, winit does have some API's that can only be accessed on the main thread. `prepare_windows` in the render schedule thus needs to be scheduled on the main thread. Currently we run nonsend systems by running them on the thread the TaskPool::scope runs on. When we move render to another thread this no longer works.
    
    To fix this, a new `scope_with_executor` method was added that takes a optional `TheadExecutor` that can only be ticked on the thread it was initialized on. The render world then holds a `MainThreadExecutor` resource which can be passed to the scope in the parallel executor that it uses to spawn it's non send systems on.
    
    ### Scopes executors between render and main should not share tasks
    
    Since the render world and the app world share the `ComputeTaskPool`. Because `scope` has executors for the ComputeTaskPool a system from the main world could run on the render thread or a render system could run on the main thread. This can cause performance problems because it can delay a stage from finishing. See https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6503#issuecomment-1309791442 for more details.
    
    To avoid this problem, `TaskPool::scope` has been changed to not tick the ComputeTaskPool when it's used by the parallel executor. In the future when we move closer to the 1 thread to 1 logical core model we may want to overprovide threads, because the render and main app threads don't do much when executing the schedule.
    
    ## Performance
    
    My machine is Windows 11, AMD Ryzen 5600x, RX 6600
    
    ### Examples
    
    #### This PR with pipelining vs Main
    
    > Note that these were run on an older version of main and the performance profile has probably changed due to optimizations
    
    Seeing a perf gain from 29% on many lights to 7% on many sprites.

    #### This PR with pipelining disabled vs Main
    
    Mostly regressions here. I don't think this should be a problem as users that are disabling pipelined rendering are probably running single threaded and not using the parallel executor. The regression is probably mostly due to the switch to use `async_executor::run` instead of `try_tick` and also having one less thread to run systems on. I'll do a writeup on why switching to `run` causes regressions, so we can try to eventually fix it. Using try_tick causes issues when pipeline rendering is enable as seen [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6503#issuecomment-1380803518)

    ### Benchmarks
    
    Mostly the same except empty_systems has got a touch slower. The maybe_pipelining+1 column has the compute task pool with an extra thread over default added. This is because pipelining loses one thread over main to execute systems on, since the main thread no longer runs normal systems.

    ### App `runner` and SubApp `extract` functions are now required to be Send
    
    This was changed to enable pipelined rendering. If this breaks your use case please report it as these new bounds might be able to be relaxed.
    
    ## ToDo
    
    * [x] redo benchmarking
    * [x] reinvestigate the perf of the try_tick -> run change for task pool scope

    Add depth and normal prepass  (#6284)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add a configurable prepass
    - A depth prepass is useful for various shader effects and to reduce overdraw. It can be expansive depending on the scene so it's important to be able to disable it if you don't need any effects that uses it or don't suffer from excessive overdraw.
    - The goal is to eventually use it for things like TAA, Ambient Occlusion, SSR and various other techniques that can benefit from having a prepass.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The prepass node is inserted before the main pass. It runs for each `Camera3d` with a prepass component (`DepthPrepass`, `NormalPrepass`). The presence of one of those components is used to determine which textures are generated in the prepass. When any prepass is enabled, the depth buffer generated will be used by the main pass to reduce overdraw.
    
    The prepass runs for each `Material` created with the `MaterialPlugin::prepass_enabled` option set to `true`. You can overload the shader used by the prepass by using `Material::prepass_vertex_shader()` and/or `Material::prepass_fragment_shader()`. It will also use the `Material::specialize()` for more advanced use cases. It is enabled by default on all materials.
    
    The prepass works on opaque materials and materials using an alpha mask. Transparent materials are ignored.
    
    The `StandardMaterial` overloads the prepass fragment shader to support alpha mask and normal maps.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Add a new `PrepassNode` that runs before the main pass
    - Add a `PrepassPlugin` to extract/prepare/queue the necessary data
    - Add a `DepthPrepass` and `NormalPrepass` component to control which textures will be created by the prepass and available in later passes.
    - Add a new `prepass_enabled` flag to the `MaterialPlugin` that will control if a material uses the prepass or not.
    - Add a new `prepass_enabled` flag to the `PbrPlugin` to control if the StandardMaterial uses the prepass. Currently defaults to false.
    - Add `Material::prepass_vertex_shader()` and `Material::prepass_fragment_shader()` to control the prepass from the `Material`
    
    ## Notes
    
    In bevy's sample 3d scene, the performance is actually worse when enabling the prepass, but on more complex scenes the performance is generally better. I would like more testing on this, but @DGriffin91 has reported a very noticeable improvements in some scenes.
    
    The prepass is also used by @JMS55 for TAA and GTAO

    Improve safety for `CommandQueue` internals (#7039)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Safety comments for the `CommandQueue` type are quite sparse and very imprecise. Sometimes, they are right for the wrong reasons or use circular reasoning.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Document previously-implicit safety invariants.
    - Rewrite safety comments to actually reflect the specific invariants of each operation.
    - Use `OwningPtr` instead of raw pointers, to encode an invariant in the type system instead of via comments.
    - Use typed pointer methods when possible to increase reliability.

    ## Changelog
    
    + Added the function `OwningPtr::read_unaligned`.

    Windows as Entities (#5589)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fix https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4530
    
    - Make it easier to open/close/modify windows by setting them up as `Entity`s with a `Window` component.
    - Make multiple windows very simple to set up. (just add a `Window` component to an entity and it should open)
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Move all properties of window descriptor to ~components~ a component.
    - Replace `WindowId` with `Entity`.
    - ~Use change detection for components to update backend rather than events/commands. (The `CursorMoved`/`WindowResized`/... events are kept for user convenience.~
      Check each field individually to see what we need to update, events are still kept for user convenience.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `WindowDescriptor` renamed to `Window`.
        - Width/height consolidated into a `WindowResolution` component.
        - Requesting maximization/minimization is done on the [`Window::state`] field.
    - `WindowId` is now `Entity`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Replace `WindowDescriptor` with `Window`.
        - Change `width` and `height` fields in a `WindowResolution`, either by doing
          ```rust
          WindowResolution::new(width, height) // Explicitly
          // or using From<_> for tuples for convenience
          (1920., 1080.).into()
          ```
    - Replace any `WindowCommand` code to just modify the `Window`'s fields directly  and creating/closing windows is now by spawning/despawning an entity with a `Window` component like so:
      ```rust
      let window = commands.spawn(Window { ... }).id(); // open window
      commands.entity(window).despawn(); // close window
      ```
    
    ## Unresolved
    - ~How do we tell when a window is minimized by a user?~
      ~Currently using the `Resize(0, 0)` as an indicator of minimization.~
      No longer attempting to tell given how finnicky this was across platforms, now the user can only request that a window be maximized/minimized.
    
     ## Future work
     - Move `exit_on_close` functionality out from windowing and into app(?)

    Docs: App::run() might never return; effect of WinitSettings::return_from_run. (#7228)
    
    # Objective
    
    See:
    
    - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/7067#issuecomment-1381982285
      - (This does not fully close that issue in my opinion.)
    - https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1063454009769340989
    
    ## Solution
    
    This merge request adds documentation:
    
    1. Alert users to the fact that `App::run()` might never return and code placed after it might never be executed.
    2. Makes `winit::WinitSettings::return_from_run` discoverable.
    3. Better explains why `winit::WinitSettings::return_from_run` is discouraged and better links to up-stream docs. on that topic.
    4. Adds notes to the `app/return_after_run.rs` example which otherwise promotes a feature that carries caveats.
    
    Furthermore, w.r.t `winit::WinitSettings::return_from_run`:
    
    - Broken links to `winit` docs are fixed.
    - Links now point to BOTH `EventLoop::run()` and `EventLoopExtRunReturn::run_return()` which are the salient up-stream pages and make more sense, taken together.
    - Collateral damage: "Supported platforms" heading; disambiguation of "run" → `App::run()`; links.
    
    ## Future Work
    
    I deliberately structured the "`run()` might not return" section under `App::run()` to allow for alternative patterns (e.g. `AppExit` event, `WindowClosed` event) to be listed or mentioned, beneath it, in the future.

    Fix init_non_send_resource overwriting previous values (#7261)
    
    # Objective
    
    Repeated calls to `init_non_send_resource` currently overwrite the old value because the wrong storage is being checked.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use the correct storage. Add some tests.
    
    ## Notes
    
    Without the fix, the new test fails with
    ```
    thread 'world::tests::init_non_send_resource_does_not_overwrite' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
      left: `1`,

    update doc comment for new_archetype in query-state (#7241)
    
    # Objective
    
    I was reading through the bevy_ecs code, trying to understand how everything works.
    I was getting a bit confused when reading the doc comment for the `new_archetype` function; it looks like it doesn't create a new archetype but instead updates some internal state in the SystemParam to facility QueryIteration.
    
    (I still couldn't find where a new archetype was actually created)
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Adding a doc comment with a more correct explanation.
    
    If it's deemed correct, I can also update the doc-comment for the other `new_archetype` calls

    Reduce the use of atomics in the render phase (#7084)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up the render phase of rendering. An extension of #6885.
    
    `SystemState::get` increments the `World`'s change tick atomically every time it's called. This is notably more expensive than a unsynchronized increment, even without contention. It also updates the archetypes, even when there has been nothing to update when it's called repeatedly.
    
    ## Solution
    Piggyback off of #6885. Split `SystemState::validate_world_and_update_archetypes` into `SystemState::validate_world` and `SystemState::update_archetypes`, and make the later `pub`. Then create safe variants of `SystemState::get_unchecked_manual` that still validate the `World` but do not update archetypes and do not increment the change tick using `World::read_change_tick` and `World::change_tick`. Update `RenderCommandState` to call `SystemState::update_archetypes` in `Draw::prepare` and `SystemState::get_manual` in `Draw::draw`.
    
    ## Performance
    There's a slight perf benefit (~2%) for `main_opaque_pass_3d` on `many_foxes` (340.39 us -> 333.32 us)
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3137680/210643746-25320b98-3e2b-4a95-8084-892c23bb8b4e.png)
    
    ## Alternatives
    We can change `SystemState::get` to not increment the `World`'s change tick. Though this would still put updating the archetypes and an atomic read on the hot-path.

    Remove VerticalAlign from TextAlignment (#6807)
    
    # Objective
    
    Remove the `VerticalAlign` enum.
    
    Text's alignment field should only affect the text's internal text alignment, not its position. The only way to control a `TextBundle`'s position and bounds should be through the manipulation of the constraints in the `Style` components of the nodes in the Bevy UI's layout tree.
    
     `Text2dBundle` should have a separate `Anchor` component that sets its position relative to its transform.
    
    Related issues: #676, #1490, #5502, #5513, #5834, #6717, #6724, #6741, #6748
    
    ## Changelog
    * Changed `TextAlignment` into an enum with `Left`, `Center`, and `Right` variants.
    * Removed the `HorizontalAlign` and `VerticalAlign` types.
    * Added an `Anchor` component to `Text2dBundle`
    * Added `Component` derive to `Anchor`
    * Use `f32::INFINITY` instead of `f32::MAX` to represent unbounded text in Text2dBounds
    
    ## Migration Guide
    The `alignment` field of `Text` now only affects the text's internal alignment.
    
    ### Change `TextAlignment` to TextAlignment` which is now an enum. Replace:
      * `TextAlignment::TOP_LEFT`, `TextAlignment::CENTER_LEFT`, `TextAlignment::BOTTOM_LEFT` with `TextAlignment::Left`
      * `TextAlignment::TOP_CENTER`, `TextAlignment::CENTER_LEFT`, `TextAlignment::BOTTOM_CENTER` with `TextAlignment::Center`
      * `TextAlignment::TOP_RIGHT`, `TextAlignment::CENTER_RIGHT`, `TextAlignment::BOTTOM_RIGHT` with `TextAlignment::Right`
    
    ### Changes for `Text2dBundle`
    `Text2dBundle` has a new field 'text_anchor' that takes an `Anchor` component that controls its position relative to its transform.

    # Objective
    
    - Enabling the `debug_asset_server` feature doesn't compile when using it with `load_internal_binary_asset!()`. The issue is because it assumes the loader takes an `&'static str` as a parameter, but binary assets loader expect `&'static [u8]`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a generic type for the loader and use a different type in `load_internal_asset` and `load_internal_binary_asset`

    Improve change detection behavior for transform propagation (#6870)
    
    # Objective
    Fix #4647. If any child is changed, or even reordered, `Changed<Children>` is true, which causes transform propagation to propagate changes to all siblings of a changed child, even if they don't need to be.
    
    ## Solution
    As `Parent` and `Children` are updated in tandem in hierarchy commands after #4800. `Changed<Parent>` is true on the child when `Changed<Children>` is true on the parent. However, unlike checking children, checking `Changed<Parent>` is only localized to the current entity and will not force propagation to the siblings.
    
    Also took the opportunity to change propagation to use `Query::iter_many` instead of repeated `Query::get` calls. Should cut a bit of the overhead out of propagation. This means we won't panic when there isn't a `Parent` on the child, just skip over it.
    
    The tests from #4608 still pass, so the change detection here still works just fine under this approach.

    Fix incorrect behavior of `just_pressed` and `just_released` in `Input<GamepadButton>` (#7238)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes a bug where `just_pressed` and `just_released` in `Input<GamepadButton>` might behave incorrectly due calling `clear` 3 times in a single frame through these three different systems: `gamepad_button_event_system`, `gamepad_axis_event_system` and `gamepad_connection_system` in any order
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Call `clear` only once and before all the above three systems, i.e. in `gamepad_event_system`
    
    ## Additional Info

    Fix Alien Cake Addict example despawn warnings (#7236)
    
    # Problem
    The example's `teardown` system despawns all entities besides the camera using `despawn_recursive` causing it to despawn child entities multiple times which logs a warning.

    Fix axis settings constructor (#7233)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, the `AxisSettings::new` function is unusable due to
    an implementation quirk. It only allows `AxisSettings` where
    the bounds that are supposed to be positive are negative!
    
    ## Solution
    
    - We fix the bound check
    - We add a test to make sure the method is usable
    
    
    Seems like the error slipped through because of the relatively
    verbose code style. With all those `if/else`, very long names,
    range syntax, the bound check is actually hard to spot. I first
    refactored a lot of code, but I left out the refactor because the
    fix should be integrated independently.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Fix `AxisSettings::new` only accepting invalid bounds

    Make PipelineCache internally mutable. (#7205)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow rendering queue systems to use a `Res<PipelineCache>` even for queueing up new rendering pipelines. This is part of unblocking parallel execution queue systems.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make `PipelineCache` internally mutable w.r.t to queueing new pipelines. Pipelines are no longer immediately updated into the cache state, but rather queued into a Vec. The Vec of pending new pipelines is then later processed at the same time we actually create the queued pipelines on the GPU device.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    `PipelineCache` no longer requires mutable access in order to queue render / compute pipelines.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    * Most usages of `resource_mut::<PipelineCache>` and `ResMut<PipelineCache>` can be changed to `resource::<PipelineCache>` and `Res<PipelineCache>` as long as they don't use any methods requiring mutability - the only public method requiring it is `process_queue`.

    Improve safety for `BlobVec::replace_unchecked` (#7181)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The function `BlobVec::replace_unchecked` has informal use of safety comments.
    - This function does strange things with `OwningPtr` in order to get around the borrow checker.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Put safety comments in front of each unsafe operation. Describe the specific invariants of each operation and how they apply here.
    - Added a guard type `OnDrop`, which is used to simplify ownership transfer in case of a panic.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    + Added the guard type `bevy_utils::OnDrop`.
    + Added conversions from `Ptr`, `PtrMut`, and `OwningPtr` to `NonNull<u8>`.

    Fix #5248.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Support `In<T>` parameters and allow returning arbitrary types in exclusive systems.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Exclusive systems may now be used with system piping.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Exclusive systems (systems that access `&mut World`) now support system piping, so the `ExclusiveSystemParamFunction` trait now has generics for the `In`put and `Out`put types.
    
    ```rust
    // Before
    fn my_generic_system<T, Param>(system_function: T)

    Subject Matter Experts and new Bevy Org docs (#7185)
    
    We are in the process of rolling out a new Bevy Organization role! (Subject Matter Expert)
    
    This adds a new "The Bevy Organization" document and links to it from CONTRIBUTING.md. This doc describes how the Bevy Organization will work going forward. It outlines the functionality of each role, as well as the expectations we have for them. The previously existing roles (Project Lead, Maintainer) still work the same way, but their definition and scope have been made much clearer.
    
    Tomorrow we will be announcing this publicly in a blog post. This will describe the motivation and announce the first round of SMEs . But before that  it makes sense to do a quick review round first.
    
    Given the quick turnaround on this PR, this isn't the best platform to discuss changes to the SME system (or its validity). After you have read the announcement tomorrow, feel free to start discussions wherever is preferable to you (this repo, discord, etc). So for now, please just review for clarity / typos / phrasing / missed info / etc.

    Implement `Clone` for all pipeline types (#6653)
    
    # Objective
    
    Pipelines can be customized by wrapping an existing pipeline in a newtype and adding custom logic to its implementation of `SpecializedMeshPipeline::specialize`. To make that easier, the wrapped pipeline type needs to implement `Clone`.
    
    For example, the current non-cloneable pipelines require wrapper pipelines to pull apart the wrapped pipeline like this:
    
    ```rust
    impl FromWorld for Wireframe2dPipeline {
        fn from_world(world: &mut World) -> Self {
            let p = &world.resource::<Material2dPipeline<ColorMaterial>>();
            Self {
                mesh2d_pipeline: p.mesh2d_pipeline.clone(),
                material2d_layout: p.material2d_layout.clone(),
                vertex_shader: p.vertex_shader.clone(),
                fragment_shader: p.fragment_shader.clone(),
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Derive or implement `Clone` on all built-in pipeline types. This is easy to do since they mostly just contain cheaply clonable reference-counted types.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Implement `Clone` for all pipeline types.

    refactor: move internals from `entity_ref` to `World`, add `SAFETY` comments (#6402)
    
    # Objective
    
    There are some utility functions for actually working with `Storages` inside `entity_ref.rs` that are used both for `EntityRef/EntityMut` and `World`, with a `// TODO: move to Storages`.
    This PR moves them to private methods on `World`, because that's the safest API boundary. On `Storages` you would need to ensure that you pass `Components` from the same world.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - move get_component[_with_type], get_ticks[_with_type], get_component_and_ticks[_with_type] to `World` (still pub(crate))
    - replace `pub use entity_ref::*;` with `pub use entity_ref::{EntityRef, EntityMut}` and qualified `entity_ref::get_mut[_by_id]` in `world.rs`
    - add safety comments to a bunch of methods

    # Objective
    
    * `World::init_resource` and `World::get_resource_or_insert_with` are implemented naively, and as such they perform duplicate `TypeId -> ComponentId` lookups.
    * `World::get_resource_or_insert_with` contains an additional duplicate `ComponentId -> ResourceData` lookup.
        * This function also contains an unnecessary panic branch, which we rely on the optimizer to be able to remove.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Implement the functions using engine-internal code, instead of combining high-level functions. This allows computed variables to persist across different branches, instead of being recomputed.

    Add an extension trait to `EntityCommands` to update hierarchy while preserving `GlobalTransform` (#7024)
    
    # Objective
    
    It is often necessary  to update an entity's parent
    while keeping its GlobalTransform static. Currently
    it is cumbersome and error-prone (two questions in
    the discord `#help` channel in the past week)
    
    - Part 2, resolves #5475
    - Builds on: #7020.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added the `BuildChildrenTransformExt` trait, it is part
      of `bevy::prelude` and adds the following methods to `EntityCommands`:
      - `set_parent_in_place`: Change the parent of an entity and
        update its `Transform` in order to preserve its `GlobalTransform` after the parent change
      - `remove_parent_in_place`: Remove an entity from a hierarchy,
        while preserving its `GlobalTransform`.

    Improve render phase documentation (#7016)
    
    # Objective
    
    The documentation of the bevy_render crate is still pretty incomplete.
    This PR follows up on #6885 and improves the documentation of the `render_phase` module.
    This module contains one of our most important rendering abstractions and the current documentation is pretty confusing. This PR tries to clarify what all of these pieces are for and how they work together to form bevy`s modular rendering logic.
    
    ## Solution
    
    ### Code Reformating
    - I have moved the `rangefinder` into the `render_phase` module since it is only used there.
    - I have moved the `PhaseItem` (and the `BatchedPhaseItem`) from `render_phase::draw` over to `render_phase::mod`. This does not change the public-facing API since they are reexported anyway, but this change makes the relation between `RenderPhase` and `PhaseItem` clear and easier to discover.
    
    ### Documentation
    - revised all documentation in the `render_phase` module
    - added a module-level explanation of how `RenderPhase`s, `RenderPass`es, `PhaseItem`s, `Draw` functions, and `RenderCommands` relate to each other and how they are used
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog

    Mark TableRow and TableId as repr(transparent) (#7166)
    
    # Objective
    Following #6681, both `TableRow` and `TableId` are now part of `EntityLocation`. However, the safety invariant on `EntityLocation` requires that all of the constituent fields are `repr(transprent)` or `repr(C)` and the bit pattern of all 1s must be valid. This is not true for `TableRow` and `TableId` currently.
    
    ## Solution
    Mark `TableRow` and `TableId` to satisfy the safety requirement. Add safety comments on `ArchetypeId`, `ArchetypeRow`, `TableId` and `TableRow`.

    Ensure Ptr/PtrMut/OwningPtr are aligned when casting in debug builds (#7117)
    
    # Objective
    Improve safety testing when using `bevy_ptr` types. This is a follow-up to #7113.
    
    ## Solution
    Add a debug-only assertion that pointers are aligned when casting to a concrete type. This should very quickly catch any unsoundness from unaligned pointers, even without miri. However, this can have a large negative perf impact on debug builds.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Added: `Ptr::deref` will now panic in debug builds if the pointer is not aligned.
    Added: `PtrMut::deref_mut` will now panic in debug builds if the pointer is not aligned.
    Added: `OwningPtr::read` will now panic in debug builds if the pointer is not aligned.
    Added: `OwningPtr::drop_as` will now panic in debug builds if the pointer is not aligned.

    - I tried to create a fork of bevy_rapier to track latest bevy main branch. But bevy_rapier depends on bevy internal `propagate_transforms` system (see https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier/blob/master/src/plugin/plugin.rs#L64).
    - `propagate_transforms` system was changed to private in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4775.
    
    I don't know if it's reasonable that making `propagate_transforms` public. I also created an issue to bevy_rapier https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier/issues/307 to see how offical team will solve this issue.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - make `propagate_transforms` system public.

    Add a method for converting `MutUntyped` -> `Mut<T>` (#7113)
    
    # Objective
    
    `MutUntyped` is a struct that stores a `PtrMut` alongside change tick metadata. Working with this type is cumbersome, and has few benefits over storing the pointer and change ticks separately.
    
    Related: #6430 (title is out of date)
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a convenience method for transforming an untyped change detection pointer into its typed counterpart.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added the method `MutUntyped::with_type`.

    bevy_reflect: Add simple enum support to reflection paths (#6560)
    
    # Objective
    
    Enums are now reflectable, but are not accessible via reflection paths.
    
    This would allow us to do things like:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct MyStruct {
      data: MyEnum
    }
    
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct MyEnum {
      Foo(u32, u32),
      Bar(bool)
    }
    
    let x = MyStruct {
      data: MyEnum::Foo(123),
    };
    
    assert_eq!(*x.get_path::<u32>("data.1").unwrap(), 123);
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added support for enums in reflection paths.
    
    ##### Note
    This uses a simple approach of just getting the field with the given accessor. It does not do matching or anything else to ensure the enum is the intended variant. This means that the variant must be known ahead of time or matched outside the reflection path (i.e. path to variant, perform manual match, and continue pathing).
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added support for enums in reflection paths

    bevy_reflect: Simplify `take`-or-else-`from_reflect` operation (#6566)
    
    # Objective
    
    There are times where we want to simply take an owned `dyn Reflect` and cast it to a type `T`.
    
    Currently, this involves doing:
    
    ```rust
    let value = value.take::<T>().unwrap_or_else(|value| {
      T::from_reflect(&*value).unwrap_or_else(|| {
        panic!(
          "expected value of type {} to convert to type {}.",
          value.type_name(),
          std::any::type_name::<T>()
        )
      })
    });
    ```
    
    This is a common operation that could be easily be simplified.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the `FromReflect::take_from_reflect` method. This first tries to `take` the value, calling `from_reflect` iff that fails.
    
    ```rust
    let value = T::take_from_reflect(value).unwrap_or_else(|value| {
      panic!(
        "expected value of type {} to convert to type {}.",
        value.type_name(),
        std::any::type_name::<T>()
      )
    });
    ```
    
    Based on suggestion from @soqb on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1002362493634629796/1041046880316043374).

    Added Ref to allow immutable access with change detection (#7097)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #7066
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Split the ChangeDetection trait into ChangeDetection and ChangeDetectionMut
    - Added Ref as equivalent to &T with change detection
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Support for Ref which allow inspecting change detection flags in an immutable way
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - While bevy prelude includes both ChangeDetection and ChangeDetectionMut any code explicitly referencing ChangeDetection might need to be updated to ChangeDetectionMut or both. Specifically any reading logic requires ChangeDetection while writes requires ChangeDetectionMut.
    
    use bevy_ecs::change_detection::DetectChanges -> use bevy_ecs::change_detection::{DetectChanges, DetectChangesMut}
    
    - Previously Res had methods to access change detection `is_changed` and `is_added` those methods have been moved to the `DetectChanges` trait. If you are including bevy prelude you will have access to these types otherwise you will need to `use bevy_ecs::change_detection::DetectChanges` to continue using them.

    Document alignment requirements of `Ptr`, `PtrMut` and `OwningPtr` (#7151)
    
    # Objective
    
    The types in the `bevy_ptr` accidentally did not document anything relating to alignment. This is unsound as many methods rely on the pointer being correctly aligned.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR introduces new safety invariants on the `$ptr::new`, `$ptr::byte_offset` and `$ptr::byte_add` methods requiring them to keep the pointer aligned. This is consistent with the documentation of these pointer types which document them as being "type erased borrows".
    
    As it was pointed out (by @JoJoJet in #7117) that working with unaligned pointers can be useful (for example our commands abstraction which does not try to align anything properly, see #7039) this PR also introduces a default type parameter to all the pointer types that specifies whether it has alignment requirements or not. I could not find any code in `bevy_ecs` that would need unaligned pointers right now so this is going unused.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Correctly document alignment requirements on `bevy_ptr` types.
    - Support variants of `bevy_ptr` types that do not require being correctly aligned for the pointee type.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Safety invariants on `bevy_ptr` types' `new` `byte_add` and `byte_offset` methods have been changed. All callers should re-audit for soundness.

    Thread executor for running tasks on specific threads. (#7087)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Spawn tasks from other threads onto an async executor, but limit those tasks to run on a specific thread.
    - This is a continuation of trying to break up some of the changes in pipelined rendering.
    - Eventually this will be used to allow `NonSend` systems to run on the main thread in pipelined rendering #6503 and also to solve #6552.
    - For this specific PR this allows for us to store a thread executor in a thread local, rather than recreating a scope executor for every scope which should save on a little work.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - We create a Executor that does a runtime check for what thread it's on before creating a !Send ticker. The ticker is the only way for the executor to make progress.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - create a ThreadExecutor that can only be ticked on one thread.

    Make `Query` fields private (#7149)
    
    `Query`'s fields being `pub(crate)` means that the struct can be constructed via safe code from anywhere in `bevy_ecs` . This is Not Good since it is intended that all construction of this type goes through `Query::new` which is an `unsafe fn` letting various `Query` methods rely on those invariants holding even though they can be trivially bypassed.
    
    This has no user facing impact

    Remove the `GlobalTransform::translation_mut` method (#7134)
    
    # Objective
    
    It is possible to manually update `GlobalTransform`.
    The engine actually assumes this is not possible.
    For example, `propagate_transform` does not update children
    of an `Entity` which **`GlobalTransform`** changed,
    leading to unexpected behaviors.
    
    A `GlobalTransform` set by the user may also be blindly
    overwritten by the propagation system.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove `translation_mut`
    - Explain to users that they shouldn't manually update the `GlobalTransform`
    - Remove `global_vs_local.rs` example, since it misleads users
      in believing that it is a valid use-case to manually update the
      `GlobalTransform`
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Remove `GlobalTransform::translation_mut`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `GlobalTransform::translation_mut` has been removed without alternative,
    if you were relying on this, update the `Transform` instead. If the given entity
    had children or parent, you may need to remove its parent to make its transform
    independent (in which case the new `Commands::set_parent_in_place` and
    `Commands::remove_parent_in_place` may be of interest)
    
    Bevy may add in the future a way to toggle transform propagation on
    an entity basis.

    Ensure `Query` does not use the wrong `World` (#7150)
    
    `Query` relies on the `World` it stores being the same as the world used for creating the `QueryState` it stores. If they are not the same then everything is very unsound. This was not actually being checked anywhere, `Query::new` did not have a safety invariant or even an assertion that the `WorldId`'s are the same.
    
    This shouldn't have any user facing impact unless we have really messed up in bevy and have unsoundness elsewhere (in which case we would now get a panic instead of being unsound).

    Add `Mut::reborrow` (#7114)
    
    # Objective
    
    - In some cases, you need a `Mut<T>` pointer, but you only have a mutable reference to one. There is no easy way of converting `&'a mut Mut<'_, T>` -> `Mut<'a, T>` outside of the engine.
    
    ### Example (Before)
    
    ```rust
    fn do_with_mut<T>(val: Mut<T>) { ... }
    
    for x: Mut<T> in &mut query {
        // The function expects a `Mut<T>`, so `x` gets moved here.
        do_with_mut(x);
        // Error: use of moved value.
        do_a_thing(&x);
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add the function `reborrow`, which performs the mapping. This is analogous to `PtrMut::reborrow`.
    
    ### Example (After)
    
    ```rust
    fn do_with_mut<T>(val: Mut<T>) { ... }
    
    for x: Mut<T> in &mut query {
        // We reborrow `x`, so the original does not get moved.
        do_with_mut(x.reborrow());
        // Works fine.
        do_a_thing(&x);
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added the method `reborrow` to `Mut`, `ResMut`, `NonSendMut`, and `MutUntyped`.

    Add `TypeRegistrationDeserializer` and remove `BorrowedStr` (#7094)
    
    # Objective
    
    This a follow-up to #6894, see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6894#discussion_r1045203113
    
    The goal is to avoid cloning any string when getting a `&TypeRegistration` corresponding to a string which is being deserialized. As a bonus code duplication is also reduced.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The manual deserialization of a string and lookup into the type registry has been moved into a separate `TypeRegistrationDeserializer` type, which implements `DeserializeSeed` with a `Visitor` that accepts any string with `visit_str`, even ones that may not live longer than that function call.
    `BorrowedStr` has been removed since it's no longer used.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - The type `TypeRegistrationDeserializer` has been added, which simplifies getting a `&TypeRegistration` while deserializing a string.

    Panic on dropping NonSend in non-origin thread. (#6534)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #3310. Fixes #6282. Fixes #6278. Fixes #3666.
    
    ## Solution
    Split out `!Send` resources into `NonSendResources`. Add a `origin_thread_id` to all `!Send` Resources, check it on dropping `NonSendResourceData`, if there's a mismatch, panic. Moved all of the checks that `MainThreadValidator` would do into `NonSendResources` instead.
    
    All `!Send` resources now individually track which thread they were inserted from. This is validated against for every access, mutation, and drop that could be done against the value.
    
    A regression test using an altered version of the example from #3310 has been added.
    
    This is a stopgap solution for the current status quo. A full solution may involve fully removing `!Send` resources/components from `World`, which will likely require a much more thorough design on how to handle the existing in-engine and ecosystem use cases.
    
    This PR also introduces another breaking change:
    
    ```rust
        use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
    
        #[derive(Resource)]
        struct Resource(u32);
    
        fn main() {
            let mut world = World::new();
            world.insert_resource(Resource(1));
            world.insert_non_send_resource(Resource(2));
            let res = world.get_resource_mut::<Resource>().unwrap();
            assert_eq!(res.0, 2);
        }
    ```
    
    This code will run correctly on 0.9.1 but not with this PR, since NonSend resources and normal resources have become actual distinct concepts storage wise.
    
    ## Changelog
    Changed: Fix soundness bug with `World: Send`. Dropping a `World` that contains a `!Send` resource on the wrong thread will now panic.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Normal resources and `NonSend` resources no longer share the same backing storage. If `R: Resource`, then `NonSend<R>` and `Res<R>` will return different instances from each other. If you are using both `Res<T>` and `NonSend<T>` (or their mutable variants), to fetch the same resources, it's strongly advised to use `Res<T>`.

    Reduce branching in TrackedRenderPass (#7053)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up the render phase for rendering.
    
    ## Solution
     - Follow up #6988 and make the internals of atomic IDs `NonZeroU32`. This niches the `Option`s of the IDs in draw state, which reduces the size and branching behavior when evaluating for equality.
     - Require `&RenderDevice` to get the device's `Limits` when initializing a `TrackedRenderPass` to preallocate the bind groups and vertex buffer state in `DrawState`, this removes the branch on needing to resize those `Vec`s.
    
    ## Performance
    This produces a similar speed up akin to that of #6885. This shows an approximate 6% speed up in `main_opaque_pass_3d` on `many_foxes` (408.79 us -> 388us). This should be orthogonal to the gains seen there.

    Separate Extract from Sub App Schedule (#7046)
    
    # Objective
    
    - This pulls out some of the changes to Plugin setup and sub apps from #6503 to make that PR easier to review.
    - Separate the extract stage from running the sub app's schedule to allow for them to be run on separate threads in the future
    - Fixes #6990
    
    ## Solution
    
    - add a run method to `SubApp` that runs the schedule
    - change the name of `sub_app_runner` to extract to make it clear that this function is only for extracting data between the main app and the sub app
    - remove the extract stage from the sub app schedule so it can be run separately. This is done by adding a `setup` method to the `Plugin` trait that runs after all plugin build methods run. This is required to allow the extract stage to be removed from the schedule after all the plugins have added their systems to the stage. We will also need the setup method for pipelined rendering to setup the render thread. See https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e3267965e15f14be18eec942dcaf16807144eb05/crates/bevy_render/src/pipelined_rendering.rs#L57-L98
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Separate SubApp Extract stage from running the sub app schedule.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    ### SubApp `runner` has conceptually been changed to an `extract` function.
    
    The `runner` no longer is in charge of running the sub app schedule. It's only concern is now moving data between the main world and the sub app. The `sub_app.app.schedule` is now run for you after the provided function is called.
    
    ```rust
    // before
    fn main() {
        let sub_app = App::empty();
        sub_app.add_stage(MyStage, SystemStage::parallel());
    
        App::new().add_sub_app(MySubApp, sub_app, move |main_world, sub_app| {
            extract(app_world, render_app);
            render_app.app.schedule.run();
        });
    }
    
    // after
    fn main() {
            let sub_app = App::empty();
        sub_app.add_stage(MyStage, SystemStage::parallel());
    
        App::new().add_sub_app(MySubApp, sub_app, move |main_world, sub_app| {
            extract(app_world, render_app);
            // schedule is automatically called for you after extract is run
        });
    }
    ```

    Gamepad events refactor (#6965)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Remove redundant gamepad events
    - Simplify consuming gamepad events.
    - Refactor: Separate handling of gamepad events into multiple systems.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Removed `GamepadEventRaw`, and `GamepadEventType`.
    - Added bespoke `GamepadConnectionEvent`, `GamepadAxisChangedEvent`, and `GamepadButtonChangedEvent`.
    - Refactored `gamepad_event_system`.
    - Added `gamepad_button_event_system`, `gamepad_axis_event_system`, and `gamepad_connection_system`, which update the `Input` and `Axis` resources using their corresponding event type.
    
    Gamepad events are now handled in their own systems and have their own types.
    
    This allows for querying for gamepad events without having to match on `GamepadEventType` and makes creating handlers for specific gamepad event types, like a `GamepadConnectionEvent` or `GamepadButtonChangedEvent` possible.
    
    We remove `GamepadEventRaw` by filtering the gamepad events, using `GamepadSettings`, _at the source_, in `bevy_gilrs`. This way we can create `GamepadEvent`s directly and avoid creating `GamepadEventRaw` which do not pass the user defined filters.
    
    We expose ordered `GamepadEvent`s and we can respond to individual gamepad event types.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Replace `GamepadEvent` and `GamepadEventRaw` types with their specific gamepad event type.

    Smooth Transition between Animations (#6922)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/6338
    
    This PR allows for smooth transitions between different animations.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This PR uses very simple linear blending of animations.
    - When starting a new animation, you can give it a duration, and throughout that duration, the previous and the new animation are being linearly blended, until only the new animation is running.
    - I'm aware of https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/49 and https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/51, which are more complete solutions to this problem, but they seem still far from being implemented. Until they're ready, this PR allows for the most basic use case of blending, i.e. smoothly transitioning between different animations.

    - no bc breaking changes

    # Objective
    
    - Storage buffers are useful and not currently supported by the `AsBindGroup` derive which means you need to expand the macro if you need a storage buffer
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a new `#[storage]` attribute to the derive `AsBindGroup` macro.
            - Support and optional `read_only` parameter that defaults to false when not present.
            - Support visibility parameters like the texture and sampler attributes.
    
    ---

    bevy_render: Run calculate_bounds in the end-of-update exclusive systems (#7127)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Avoid slower than necessary first frame after spawning many entities due to them not having `Aabb`s and so being marked visible
      - Avoids unnecessarily large system and VRAM allocations as a consequence
    
    ## Solution
    
    - I noticed when debugging the `many_cubes` stress test in Xcode that the `MeshUniform` binding was much larger than it needed to be. I realised that this was because initially, all mesh entities are marked as being visible because they don't have `Aabb`s because `calculate_bounds` is being run in `PostUpdate` and there are no system commands applications before executing the visibility check systems that need the `Aabb`s. The solution then is to run the `calculate_bounds` system just before the previous system commands are applied which is at the end of the `Update` stage.

    Remove the `SystemParamState` trait and remove types like `ResState` (#6919)
    
    Spiritual successor to #5205.
    Actual successor to #6865.
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, system params are defined using three traits: `SystemParam`, `ReadOnlySystemParam`, `SystemParamState`. The behavior for each param is specified by the `SystemParamState` trait, while `SystemParam` simply defers to the state.
    
    Splitting the traits in this way makes it easier to implement within macros, but it increases the cognitive load. Worst of all, this approach requires each `MySystemParam` to have a public `MySystemParamState` type associated with it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    * Merge the trait `SystemParamState` into `SystemParam`.
    * Remove all trivial `SystemParam` state types.
      * `OptionNonSendMutState<T>`: you will not be missed.
    
    ---
    
    - [x] Fix/resolve the remaining test failure.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Removed the trait `SystemParamState`, merging its functionality into `SystemParam`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    **Note**: this should replace the migration guide for #6865.
    This is relative to Bevy 0.9, not main.
    
    The traits `SystemParamState` and `SystemParamFetch` have been removed, and their functionality has been transferred to `SystemParam`.
    
    
    ```rust
    // Before (0.9)
    impl SystemParam for MyParam<'_, '_> {
        type State = MyParamState;
    }
    unsafe impl SystemParamState for MyParamState {
        fn init(world: &mut World, system_meta: &mut SystemMeta) -> Self { ... }
    }
    unsafe impl<'w, 's> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for MyParamState {
        type Item = MyParam<'w, 's>;
        fn get_param(&mut self, ...) -> Self::Item;
    }
    unsafe impl ReadOnlySystemParamFetch for MyParamState { }
    
    // After (0.10)
    unsafe impl SystemParam for MyParam<'_, '_> {
        type State = MyParamState;
        type Item<'w, 's> = MyParam<'w, 's>;
        fn init_state(world: &mut World, system_meta: &mut SystemMeta) -> Self::State { ... }
        fn get_param<'w, 's>(state: &mut Self::State, ...) -> Self::Item<'w, 's>;
    }
    unsafe impl ReadOnlySystemParam for MyParam<'_, '_> { }
    ```
    
    The trait `ReadOnlySystemParamFetch` has been replaced with `ReadOnlySystemParam`.
    
    ```rust
    // Before
    unsafe impl ReadOnlySystemParamFetch for MyParamState {}
    
    // After
    unsafe impl ReadOnlySystemParam for MyParam<'_, '_> {}

    Added missing details to SystemParam Local documentation. (#7106)
    
    # Objective
    
    `SystemParam` `Local`s documentation currently leaves out information that should be documented.
    - What happens when multiple `SystemParam`s within the same system have the same `Local` type.
    - What lifetime parameter is expected by `Local`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added sentences to documentation to communicate this information.
    - Renamed `Local` lifetimes in code to `'s` where they previously were not. Users can get complicated incorrect suggested fixes if they pass the wrong lifetime. Some instance of the code had `'w` indicating the expected lifetime might not have been known to those that wrote the code either.

    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #7081.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Moved functionality from kitchen sink plugin `CorePlugin` to separate plugins, `TaskPoolPlugin`, `TypeRegistrationPlugin`, `FrameCountPlugin`.  `TaskPoolOptions` resource should now be used with `TaskPoolPlugin`.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Minimal changes made (code kept in `bevy_core/lib.rs`).
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - `CorePlugin` broken into separate plugins.  If not using `DefaultPlugins` or `MinimalPlugins` `PluginGroup`s, the replacement for `CorePlugin` is now to add `TaskPoolPlugin`, `TypeRegistrationPlugin`, and `FrameCountPlugin` to the app.
    
    ## Notes
    
    - Consistent with Bevy goal "modularity over deep integration" but the functionality of `TypeRegistrationPlugin` and `FrameCountPlugin` is weak (the code has to go somewhere, though!).
    - No additional tests written.

    asset: make HandleUntyped::id private (#7076)

    It is currently possible to break reference counting for assets by creating a strong `HandleUntyped` and then modifying the `id` field before dropping the handle. This should not be allowed.

    Change the `id` field visibility to private and add a getter instead. The same change was previously done for `Handle<T>` in #6176, but `HandleUntyped` was forgotten.
    
    ---
    
    ## Migration Guide

    Allow `SystemParam`s with private fields (#7056)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fix #4200
    
    Currently, `#[derive(SystemParam)]` publicly exposes each field type, which makes it impossible to encapsulate private fields.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Previously, the fields were leaked because they were used as an input generic type to the macro-generated `SystemParam::State` struct. That type has been changed to store its state in a field with a specific type, instead of a generic type.
    
    ---

    bevy_reflect: Fix deserialization with readers (#6894)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6891
    
    ## Solution
    
    Replaces deserializing map keys as `&str` with deserializing them as `String`.
    
    This bug seems to occur when using something like `File` or `BufReader` rather than bytes or a string directly (I only tested `File` and `BufReader` for `rmp-serde` and `serde_json`). This might be an issue with other `Read` impls as well (except `&[u8]` it seems).
    
    We already had passing tests for Message Pack but none that use a `File` or `BufReader`. This PR also adds or modifies tests to check for this in the future.
    
    This change was also based on [feedback](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4561#discussion_r957385136) I received in a previous PR.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Fix bug where scene deserialization using certain readers could fail (e.g. `BufReader`, `File`, etc.)

    Parallelize forward kinematics animation systems (#6785)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up animation by leveraging all threads in `ComputeTaskPool`.
    
    ## Solution
    This PR parallelizes animation sampling across all threads.
    
    To ensure that this is safely done, all animation is predicated with an ancestor query to ensure that there is no conflicting `AnimationPlayer` above each animated hierarchy that may cause this to alias.
    
    Unlike the RFC, this does not add support for reflect based "animate anything", but only extends the existing `AnimationPlayer` to support high numbers of animated characters on screen at once.
    
    ## Performance
    This cuts `many_foxes`'s frame time on my machine by a full millisecond, from 7.49ms to 6.5ms. (yellow is this PR, red is main).

    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Changed: Animation sampling now runs fully multi-threaded using threads from `ComputeTaskPool`.
    Changed: `AnimationPlayer` that are on a child or descendant of another entity with another player will no longer be run.

    Add const to methods and const defaults to bevy_ui (#5542)
    
    # Objective
    - Fixes #5529
    
    ## Solution
    - Add assosciated constants named DEFAULT to as many types as possible
    - Add const to as many methods in bevy_ui as possible
    
    I have not applied the same treatment to the bundles in bevy_ui as it would require going into other bevy crates to implement const defaults for structs in bevy_text or relies on UiImage which calls HandleUntyped.typed() which isn't const safe.
    
    Alternatively the defaults could relatively easily be turned into a macro to regain some of the readability and conciseness at the cost of explicitness.
    Such a macro that partially implements this exists as a crate here: [const-default](https://docs.rs/const-default/latest/const_default/derive.ConstDefault.html) but does not support enums.
    
    Let me know if there's anything I've missed or if I should push further into other crates.

    Flatten render commands (#6885)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up the render phase of rendering. Simplify the trait structure for render commands.
    
    ## Solution
    
     - Merge `EntityPhaseItem` into `PhaseItem` (`EntityPhaseItem::entity` -> `PhaseItem::entity`)
     - Merge `EntityRenderCommand` into `RenderCommand`.
     - Add two associated types to `RenderCommand`: `RenderCommand::ViewWorldQuery` and `RenderCommand::WorldQuery`.
     - Use the new associated types to construct two `QueryStates`s for `RenderCommandState`.
     - Hoist any `SQuery<T>` fetches in `EntityRenderCommand`s into the aformentioned two queries. Batch fetch them all at once.
    
    ## Performance
    `main_opaque_pass_3d` is slightly faster on `many_foxes` (427.52us -> 401.15us)

    bevy_pbr: Avoid copying structs and using registers in shaders (#7069)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The #7064 PR had poor performance on an M1 Max in MacOS due to significant overuse of registers resulting in 'register spilling' where data that would normally be stored in registers on the GPU is instead stored in VRAM. The latency to read from/write to VRAM instead of registers incurs a significant performance penalty.
    - Use of registers is a limiting factor in shader performance. Assignment of a struct from memory to a local variable can incur copies. Passing a variable that has struct type as an argument to a function can also incur copies. As such, these two cases can incur increased register usage and decreased performance.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove/avoid a number of assignments of light struct type data to local variables.
    - Remove/avoid a number of passing light struct type variables/data as value arguments to shader functions.

    Allow to reuse the same RenderPass for multiple RenderPhases (#7043)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The recently merged PR #7013 does not allow multiple `RenderPhase`s to share the same `RenderPass`.
    - Due to the introduced overhead we want to minimize the number of `RenderPass`es recorded during each frame.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Take a constructed `TrackedRenderPass` instead of a `RenderPassDiscriptor` as a parameter to the `RenderPhase::render` method.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    To enable multiple `RenderPhases` to share the same `TrackedRenderPass`,
    the `RenderPhase::render` signature has changed.

    pub fn render<'w>(
      &self,
      render_pass: &mut TrackedRenderPass<'w>,

    Extend EntityLocation with TableId and TableRow (#6681)
    
    # Objective
    `Query::get` and other random access methods require looking up `EntityLocation` for every provided entity, then always looking up the `Archetype` to get the table ID and table row. This requires 4 total random fetches from memory: the `Entities` lookup, the `Archetype` lookup, the table row lookup, and the final fetch from table/sparse sets. If `EntityLocation` contains the table ID and table row, only the `Entities` lookup and the final storage fetch are required.
    
    ## Solution
    Add `TableId` and table row to `EntityLocation`. Ensure it's updated whenever entities are moved around. To ensure `EntityMeta` does not grow bigger, both `TableId` and `ArchetypeId` have been shrunk to u32, and the archetype index and table row are stored as u32s instead of as usizes. This should shrink `EntityMeta` by 4 bytes, from 24 to 20 bytes, as there is no padding anymore due to the change in alignment.
    
    This idea was partially concocted by @BoxyUwU.
    
    ## Performance
    This should restore the `Query::get` "gains" lost to #6625 that were introduced in #4800 without being unsound, and also incorporates some of the memory usage reductions seen in #3678.
    
    This also removes the same lookups during add/remove/spawn commands, so there may be a bit of a speedup in commands and `Entity{Ref,Mut}`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Added: `EntityLocation::table_id`
    Added: `EntityLocation::table_row`.
    Changed: `World`s can now only hold a maximum of 2<sup>32</sup>- 1 archetypes.
    Changed: `World`s can now only hold a maximum of 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 tables.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    A `World` can only hold a maximum of 2<sup>32</sup> - 1 archetypes and tables now. If your use case requires more than this, please file an issue explaining your use case.

    bevy_reflect: Add compile fail tests for bevy_reflect (#7041)
    
    # Objective
    
    There isn't really a way to test that code using bevy_reflect compiles or doesn't compile for certain scenarios. This would be especially useful for macro-centric PRs like #6511 and #6042.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Using `bevy_ecs_compile_fail_tests` as reference, added the `bevy_reflect_compile_fail_tests` crate.
    
    Currently, this crate contains a very simple test case. This is so that we can get the basic foundation of this crate agreed upon and merged so that more tests can be added by other PRs.

    - Cursor now gets locked/hidden when rotating the camera to give it more of the effect that you are grabbing the camera.

    - We already log the adapter info on startup when bevy_render is present. It would be nice to have more info about the system to be able to ask users to submit it in bug reports
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use the `sysinfo` crate to get all the information
      - I made sure it _only_ gets the required informations to avoid unnecessary system request
    - Add a system that logs this on startup
      - This system is currently in `bevy_diagnostics` because I didn't really know where to put it.
    
    Here's an example log from my system:
    ```log

    Add a reparented_to method to `GlobalTransform` (#7020)
    
    # Objective
    
    It is often necessary  to update an entity's parent while keeping its GlobalTransform static. Currently it is cumbersome and error-prone (two questions in the discord `#help` channel in the past week)
    
    - Part 1 of #5475
    - Part 2: #7024.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `reparented_to` method to `GlobalTransform`

    Add a trait for commands that run for a given `Entity` (#7015)
    
    # Objective
    
    Resolve #6156.
    
    The most common type of command is one that runs for a single entity. Built-in commands like this can be ergonomically added to the command queue using the `EntityCommands` struct. However, adding custom entity commands to the queue is quite cumbersome. You must first spawn an entity, store its ID in a local, then construct a command using that ID and add it to the queue. This prevents method chaining, which is the main benefit of using `EntityCommands`.
    
    ### Example (before)
    
    ```rust
    struct MyCustomCommand(Entity);
    
    impl Command for MyCustomCommand { ... }
    
    let id = commands.spawn((...)).id();
    commmands.add(MyCustomCommand(id));
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the `EntityCommand` trait, which allows directly adding per-entity commands to the `EntityCommands` struct.
    
    ### Example (after)
    
    ```rust
    struct MyCustomCommand;
    
    impl EntityCommand for MyCustomCommand { ... }
    
    commands.spawn((...)).add(MyCustomCommand);
    ```
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added the trait `EntityCommand`. This is a counterpart of `Command` for types that execute code for a single entity.
    
    ## Future Work
    
    If we feel its necessary, we can simplify built-in commands (such as `Despawn`) to use this trait.

    Relax `Sync` bound on anonymous `Command`s (#7014)
    
    # Objective
    
    Any closure with the signature `FnOnce(&mut World)` implicitly implements the trait `Command` due to a blanket implementation. However, this implementation unnecessarily has the `Sync` bound, which limits the types that can be used.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Remove the bound.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `Command` closures no longer need to implement the marker trait `std::marker::Sync`.

    Rename camera "priority" to "order" (#6908)
    
    # Objective
    The documentation for camera priority is very confusing at the moment, it requires a bit of "double negative" kind of thinking.
    
    # Solution
    Flipping the wording on the documentation to reflect more common usecases like having an overlay camera and also renaming it to "order", since priority implies that it will override the other camera rather than have both run.

    enum `Visibility` component (#6320)
    
    Consolidation of all the feedback about #6271 as well as the addition of an "unconditionally visible" mode.
    
    # Objective
    
    The current implementation of the `Visibility` struct simply wraps a boolean.. which seems like an odd pattern when rust has such nice enums that allow for more expression using pattern-matching.
    
    Additionally as it stands Bevy only has two settings for visibility of an entity:
    - "unconditionally hidden" `Visibility { is_visible: false }`,
    - "inherit visibility from parent" `Visibility { is_visible: true }`
       where a root level entity set to "inherit" is visible.
    
    Note that given the behaviour, the current naming of the inner field is a little deceptive or unclear.
    
    Using an enum for `Visibility` opens the door for adding an extra behaviour mode. This PR adds a new "unconditionally visible" mode, which causes an entity to be visible even if its Parent entity is hidden. There should not really be any performance cost to the addition of this new mode.
    
    --
    The recently added `toggle` method is removed in this PR, as its semantics could be confusing with 3 variants.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Change the Visibility component into
    ```rust
    enum Visibility {
      Hidden,    // unconditionally hidden
      Visible,   // unconditionally visible
      Inherited, // inherit visibility from parent
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    `Visibility` is now an enum
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - evaluation of the `visibility.is_visible` field should now check for `visibility == Visibility::Inherited`.
    - setting the `visibility.is_visible` field should now directly set the value: `*visibility = Visibility::Inherited`.
    - usage of `Visibility::VISIBLE` or `Visibility::INVISIBLE` should now use `Visibility::Inherited` or `Visibility::Hidden` respectively.
    - `ComputedVisibility::INVISIBLE` and `SpatialBundle::VISIBLE_IDENTITY` have been renamed to `ComputedVisibility::HIDDEN` and `SpatialBundle::INHERITED_IDENTITY` respectively.

    Replace UUID based IDs with a atomic-counted ones (#6988)
    
    # Objective
    
    - alternative to #2895
    - as mentioned in #2535 the uuid based ids in the render module should be replaced with atomic-counted ones
    
    ## Solution
    - instead of generating a random UUID for each render resource, this implementation increases an atomic counter
    - this might be replaced by the ids of wgpu if they expose them directly in the future
    
    - I have not benchmarked this solution yet, but this should be slightly faster in theory.
    - Bevymark does not seem to be affected much by this change, which is to be expected.
    
    - Nothing of our API has changed, other than that the IDs have lost their IMO rather insignificant documentation.
    - Maybe the documentation could be added back into the macro, but this would complicate the code.

    Organized scene_viewer into plugins for reuse and organization (#6936)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR reorganizes majority of the scene viewer example into a module of plugins which then allows reuse of functionality among new or existing examples.  In addition, this enables the scene viewer to be more succinct and showcase the distinct cases of camera control and scene control.
    
    This work is to support future work in organization and future examples.  A more complicated 3D scene example has been requested by the community (#6551) which requests functionality currently included in scene_viewer, but previously inaccessible.  The future example can now just utilize the two plugins created here.  The existing example [animated_fox example] can utilize the scene creation and animation control functionality of `SceneViewerPlugin`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Created a `scene_viewer` module inside the `tools` example folder.
    - Created two plugins:  `SceneViewerPlugin` (gltf scene loading, animation control, camera tracking control, light control) and `CameraControllerPlugin` (controllable camera).
    - Original `scene_viewer.rs` moved to `scene_viewer/main.rs` and now utilizes the two plugins.

    Fix suppression of all console logs when `trace_tracy` is enabled (#6955)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6862 (oh hey good catch @alice-i-cecile)
    
    Bevy was failing to print events from `info!()` and friends to the console if the `trace_tracy` feature was enabled. It shouldn't be doing that.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The problem was this per-layer filter that was added in #4320 to suppress a noisy per-frame event (which Tracy requires in order to properly close out a frame):
    
    - The problem event's target was `"bevy_render::renderer"`, not `"tracy"`. - So, the filter wasn't specifically targeting the noisy event.
    - Without a default, `tracing_subscriber::filter::Targets` will remove _everything_ that doesn't match an explicit target rule. - So, the filter _was_ silencing the noisy event, along with everything else.
    
    This PR changes that filter to do what was probably intended in #4320: suppress ~any events more verbose than `ERROR` from `bevy_render::renderer`~ the one problematically noisy event, but allow anything else that already made it through the top-level filter_layer.
    
    Also, adds a comment to clarify the intent of that filter, since it's otherwise a bit opaque and required some research.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Fixed a bug that hid console log messages when the `trace_tracy` feature was enabled.

    - It seems that when using URL fragment specifiers, backtick should not be used. It might be an issue of rust itself. Replacing the URL fragment specifier `[`Camera`]: bevy_render::camera::Camera` with `[Camera]: bevy_render::camera::Camera` solves this.

    Move 'startup' Resource `WgpuSettings`  into the `RenderPlugin` (#6946)
    
    # Objective
    The `WgpuSettings` resource is only used during plugin build. Move it into the `RenderPlugin` struct.
    
    Changing these settings requires re-initializing the render context, which is currently not supported.
    If it is supported in the future it should probably be more explicit than changing a field on a resource, maybe something similar to the `CreateWindow` event.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    ```rust
    // Before (0.9)
    App::new()
        .insert_resource(WgpuSettings { .. })
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    // After (0.10)
    App::new()
        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(RenderPlugin {
            wgpu_settings: WgpuSettings { .. },
        }))
    ```

    Directly extract joints into SkinnedMeshJoints (#6833)
    
    # Objective
    Following #4402, extract systems run on the render world instead of the main world, and allow retained state operations on it's resources. We're currently extracting to `ExtractedJoints` and then copying it twice during Prepare. Once into `SkinnedMeshJoints` and again into the actual GPU buffer.
    
    This makes #4902 obsolete.
    
    ## Solution
    Cut out the middle copy and directly extract joints into `SkinnedMeshJoints` and remove `ExtractedJoints` entirely.
    
    This also removes the per-frame allocation that is being made to send `ExtractedJoints` into the render world.
    
    ## Performance
    On my local machine, this halves the time for `prepare_skinned _meshes` on `many_foxes` (195.75us -> 93.93us on average).

    Add thread create/destroy callbacks to TaskPool (#6561)
    
    # Objective
    Fix #1991. Allow users to have a bit more control over the creation and finalization of the threads in `TaskPool`.
    
    ## Solution
    Add new methods to `TaskPoolBuilder` that expose callbacks that are called to initialize and finalize each thread in the `TaskPool`.
    
    Unlike the proposed solution in #1991, the callback is argument-less. If an an identifier is needed, `std::thread::current` should provide that information easily.
    
    Added a unit test to ensure that they're being called correctly.

    Shrink DrawFunctionId (#6944)
    
    # Objective
    This includes one part of #4899. The aim is to improve CPU-side rendering performance by reducing the memory footprint and bandwidth required.
    
    ## Solution
    Shrink `DrawFunctionId` to `u32`. Enforce that `u32 as usize` conversions are always safe by forbidding compilation on 16-bit platforms. This shouldn't be a breaking change since #4736 disabled compilation of `bevy_ecs` on those platforms.
    
    Shrinking `DrawFunctionId` shrinks all of the `PhaseItem` types, which is integral to sort and render phase performance.
    
    Testing against `many_cubes`, the sort phase improved by 22% (174.21us -> 141.76us per frame).
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3137680/207345422-a512b4cf-1680-46e0-9973-ea72494ebdfe.png)

    # Objective
    
    There is currently no way to iterate over key/value pairs inside an `EntityMap`, which makes the usage of this struct very awkward. I couldn't think of a good reason why the `iter()` function should not be exposed, considering the interface already exposes `keys()` and `values()`, so I made this PR.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Implement `iter()` for `EntityMap` in terms of its inner map type.

    Remove `EntityCommands::add_children` (#6942)
    
    # Objective
    Remove a method with an unfortunate name and questionable usefulness.
    Added in #4708
    
    It doesn't make sense to me for us to provide a method to work around a limitation of closures when we can simply, *not* use a closure.
    The limitation in this case is not being able to initialize a variable from inside a closure:
    
    ```rust
    let child_id;
    commands.spawn_empty().with_children(|parent| {
        // Error: passing uninitalized variable to a closure.
        child_id = parent.spawn_empty().id();
    });
    
    // Do something with child_id
    ```
    The docs for `add_children` suggest the following:
    ```rust
    let child_id = commands
        .spawn_empty()
        .add_children(|parent| parent.spawn_empty().id());
    ```
    I would instead suggest using the following snippet.
    ```rust
    let parent_id = commands.spawn_empty().id();
    let child_id = commands.spawn_empty().set_parent(parent_id).id();
    
    // To be fair, at the time of #4708 this would have been a bit more cumbersome since `set_parent` did not exist.
    ```
    
    Using `add_children` gets more unwieldy when you also want the `parent_id`.
    ```rust
    let parent_commands = commands.spawn_empty();
    let parent_id = parent_commands.id();
    let child_id = parent_commands.add_children(|parent| parent.spawn_empty().id());
    ```
    ### The name
    I see why `add_children` is named that way, it's the non-builder variant of `with_children` so it kinda makes sense,
    but now the method name situation for `add_child`, `add_children` and `push_children` is *rather* unfortunate.
    
    Removing `add_children` and renaming `push_children` to `add_children` in one go is kinda bleh, but that way we end up with the matching methods `add_child` and `add_children`.
    
    Another reason to rename `push_children` is that it's trying to mimick the `Vec` api naming but fails because `push` is for single elements. I guess it should have been `extend_children_from_slice`, but lets not name it that :)
    
    ### Questions
    ~~Should `push_children` be renamed in this PR? This would make the migration guide easier to deal with.~~
    Let's do that later.
    
    Does anyone know of a way to do a simple text/regex search through all the github repos for usage of `add_children`?
    That way we can have a better idea of how this will affect users. My guess is that usage of `add_children` is quite rare.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    The method `add_children` on `EntityCommands` was removed.
    If you were using `add_children` over `with_children` to return data out of the closure you can use `set_parent` or `add_child` to avoid the closure instead.

    Make `AsBindGroup` unsized (#6937)
    
    # Objective
    
    `AsBindGroup` can't be used as a trait object because of the constraint `Sized` and because of the associated function.
    
    This is a problem for [`bevy_atmosphere`](https://github.com/JonahPlusPlus/bevy_atmosphere) because it needs to use a trait that depends on `AsBindGroup` as a trait object, for switching out different shaders at runtime. The current solution it employs is reimplementing the trait and derive macro into that trait, instead of constraining to `AsBindGroup`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Remove the `Sized` constraint from `AsBindGroup` and add the constraint `where Self: Sized` to the associated function `bind_group_layout`. Also change `PreparedBindGroup<T: AsBindGroup>` to `PreparedBindGroup<T>` and use it as `PreparedBindGroup<Self::Data>` instead of `PreparedBindGroup<Self>`.
    
    This weakens the constraints, but increases the flexibility of `AsBindGroup`.
    I'm not entirely sure why the `Sized` constraint was there, because it worked fine without it (maybe @cart wasn't aware of use cases for `AsBindGroup` as a trait object or this was just leftover from legacy code?).
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `AsBindGroup` can be used as a trait object.

    [Rust 1.66](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/12/12/1.66.0-prerelease.html) is coming in a few days, and bevy doesn't build with it.

    Due to the trybuild test, this can't be merged until 1.66 is released.

    Move system_commands spans into apply_buffers (#6900)
    
    # Objective
    A separate `tracing` span for running a system's commands is created, even if the system doesn't have commands. This is adding extra measuring overhead (see #4892) where it's not needed.
    
    ## Solution
    Move the span into `ParallelCommandState` and `CommandQueue`'s `SystemParamState::apply`. To get the right metadata for the span, a additional `&SystemMeta` parameter was added to `SystemParamState::apply`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Added: `SystemMeta::name`
    Changed: Systems without `Commands` and  `ParallelCommands` will no longer show a "system_commands" span when profiling.
    Changed: `SystemParamState::apply` now takes a `&SystemMeta` parameter in addition to the provided `&mut World`.

    Add `set_if_neq` method to `DetectChanges` trait (Rebased) (#6853)
    
    # Objective
    
    Change detection can be spuriously triggered by setting a field to the same value as before. As a result, a common pattern is to write:
    
    ```rust
    if *foo != value {
      *foo = value;
    }
    ```
    
    This is confusing to read, and heavy on boilerplate.
    
    Adopted from #5373, but untangled and rebased to current `bevy/main`.
    
    ## Solution
    
        1. Add a method to the `DetectChanges` trait that implements this boilerplate when the appropriate trait bounds are met.
    
        2. Document this minor footgun, and point users to it.
    
    
    ## Changelog
    
        * added the `set_if_neq` method to avoid triggering change detection when the new and previous values are equal. This will work on both components and resources.
    
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If you are manually checking if a component or resource's value is equal to its new value before setting it to avoid triggering change detection, migrate to the clearer and more convenient `set_if_neq` method.
    ## Context
    
    Related to #2363 as it avoids triggering change detection, but not a complete solution (as it still requires triggering it when real changes are made).

    Remove `render` feature group (#6912)
    
    # Objective
    
    The feature doesn't have any use case in libraries or applications and many users use this feature incorrectly. See the issue for details.
    Closes #5753.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Remove it.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Removed
    
    - `render` feature group.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Instead of using `render` feature group use dependencies directly. This group consisted of `bevy_core_pipeline`, `bevy_pbr`, `bevy_gltf`, `bevy_render`, `bevy_sprite`, `bevy_text` and `bevy_ui`. You probably want to check if you need all of them.

    Document undocumented features of AsBindGroup derive (#6910)
    
    # Objective
    
    - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5364 Added a few features to the AsBindGroup derive, but if you don't know they exist they aren't documented anywhere.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Document the new arguments in the doc block for the derive.

    Remove unnecessary branching from bundle insertion (#6902)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up bundle insertion and spawning from a bundle.
    
    ## Solution
    Use the same technique used in #6800 to remove the branch on storage type when writing components from a `Bundle` into storage.
    
     - Add a `StorageType` argument to the closure on `Bundle::get_components`.
     - Pass `C::Storage::STORAGE_TYPE` into that argument.
     - Match on that argument instead of reading from a `Vec<StorageType>` in `BundleInfo`.
     - Marked all implementations of `Bundle::get_components` as inline to encourage dead code elimination.
    
    The `Vec<StorageType>` in `BundleInfo` was also removed as it's no longer needed. If users were reliant on this, they can either use the compile time constants or fetch the information from `Components`. Should save a rather negligible amount of memory.
    
    ## Performance
    Microbenchmarks show a slight improvement to inserting components into existing entities, as well as spawning from a bundle. Ranging about 8-16% faster depending on the benchmark.

    ## Solution
    Document the remaining undocumented members of `bevy_utils` and set `warn(missing_docs)` on the crate level. Also enabled `clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` as a warning on the crate to keep it in sync with `bevy_ecs`'s warnings.

    run clear trackers on render world (#6878)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6417
    
    ## Solution
    
    - clear_trackers was not being called on the render world. This causes the removed components vecs to continuously grow. This PR adds clear trackers to the end of RenderStage::Cleanup
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The call to `clear_trackers` in `App` has been moved from the schedule to App::update for the main world and calls to `clear_trackers` have been added for sub_apps in the same function. This was due to needing stronger guarantees. If clear_trackers isn't called on a world it can lead to memory leaks in `RemovedComponents`.

    Simplify trait hierarchy for `SystemParam` (#6865)
    
    # Objective
    
    * Implementing a custom `SystemParam` by hand requires implementing three traits -- four if it is read-only.
    * The trait `SystemParamFetch<'w, 's>` is a workaround from before we had generic associated types, and is no longer necessary.
    
    ## Solution
    
    * Combine the trait `SystemParamFetch` with `SystemParamState`.
        * I decided to remove the `Fetch` name and keep the `State` name, since the former was consistently conflated with the latter.
    * Replace the trait `ReadOnlySystemParamFetch` with `ReadOnlySystemParam`, which simplifies trait bounds in generic code.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Removed the trait `SystemParamFetch`, moving its functionality to `SystemParamState`.
    - Replaced the trait `ReadOnlySystemParamFetch` with `ReadOnlySystemParam`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The trait `SystemParamFetch` has been removed, and its functionality has been transferred to `SystemParamState`.
    
    ```rust
    // Before
    impl SystemParamState for MyParamState {
        fn init(world: &mut World, system_meta: &mut SystemMeta) -> Self { ... }
    }
    impl<'w, 's> SystemParamFetch<'w, 's> for MyParamState {
        type Item = MyParam<'w, 's>;
        fn get_param(...) -> Self::Item;
    }
    
    // After
    impl SystemParamState for MyParamState {
        type Item<'w, 's> = MyParam<'w, 's>; // Generic associated types!
        fn init(world: &mut World, system_meta: &mut SystemMeta) -> Self { ... }
        fn get_param<'w, 's>(...) -> Self::Item<'w, 's>;
    }
    ```
    
    The trait `ReadOnlySystemParamFetch` has been replaced with `ReadOnlySystemParam`.
    
    ```rust
    // Before
    unsafe impl ReadOnlySystemParamFetch for MyParamState {}
    
    // After
    unsafe impl<'w, 's> ReadOnlySystemParam for MyParam<'w, 's> {}

    Document options for !Sync types for Component and Resources (#6864)
    
    # Objective
    It's not clear to users how to handle `!Sync` types as components and resources in the absence of engine level support for them.
    
    ## Solution
    Added a section to `Component`'s and `Resource`'s type level docs on available options for making a type `Sync` when it holds `!Sync` fields, linking `bevy_utils::synccell::SyncCell` and the currently unstable `std::sync::Exclusive`.
    
    Also added a compile_fail doctest that illustrates how to apply `SyncCell`. These will break when/if #6572 gets merged, at which point these docs should be updated.

    # Objective
    
    - Make running animation fluid skipping 'idle' frame.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Loop through the specified indices instead of through the whole sprite sheet.
    
    The example is correct, is just the feeling that the animation loop is not seamless.
    
    Based on the solution suggested by @mockersf in #5429.

    get pixel size from wgpu (#6820)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Get rid of giant match statement to get PixelInfo.
    - This will allow for supporting any texture that is uncompressed, instead of people needing to PR in any textures that are supported in wgpu, but not bevy.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - More conservative alternative to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6788, where we don't try to make some of the calculations correct for compressed types.
    - Delete `PixelInfo` and get the pixel_size directly from wgpu. Data from wgpu is here: https://docs.rs/wgpu-types/0.14.0/src/wgpu_types/lib.rs.html#2359
    - Panic if the texture is a compressed type. An integer byte size of a pixel is no longer a valid concept when talking about compressed textures.
    - All internal usages use `pixel_size` and not `pixel_info` and are on uncompressed formats. Most of these usages are on either explicit texture formats or slightly indirectly through `TextureFormat::bevy_default()`. The other uses are in `TextureAtlas` and have other calculations that assumes the texture is uncompressed.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - remove `PixelInfo` and get `pixel_size` from wgpu
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `PixelInfo` has been removed. `PixelInfo::components` is equivalent to `texture_format.describe().components`. `PixelInfo::type_size` can be gotten from `texture_format.describe().block_size/ texture_format.describe().components`. But note this can yield incorrect results for some texture types like Rg11b10Float.

    bevy_reflect: Add `ReflectFromReflect` (v2) (#6245)
    
    # Objective
    
    Resolves #4597 (based on the work from #6056 and a refresh of #4147)
    
    When using reflection, we may often end up in a scenario where we have a Dynamic representing a certain type. Unfortunately, we can't just call `MyType::from_reflect` as we do not have knowledge of the concrete type (`MyType`) at runtime.
    
    Such scenarios happen when we call `Reflect::clone_value`, use the reflection deserializers, or create the Dynamic type ourselves.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a `ReflectFromReflect` type data struct.
    
    This struct allows us to easily convert Dynamic representations of our types into their respective concrete instances.
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]
    #[reflect(FromReflect)] // <- Register `ReflectFromReflect`
    struct MyStruct(String);
    
    let type_id = TypeId::of::<MyStruct>();
    
    // Register our type
    let mut registry = TypeRegistry::default();
    registry.register::<MyStruct>();
    
    // Create a concrete instance
    let my_struct = MyStruct("Hello world".to_string());
    
    // `Reflect::clone_value` will generate a `DynamicTupleStruct` for tuple struct types
    let dynamic_value: Box<dyn Reflect> = my_struct.clone_value();
    assert!(!dynamic_value.is::<MyStruct>());
    
    // Get the `ReflectFromReflect` type data from the registry
    let rfr: &ReflectFromReflect = registry
      .get_type_data::<ReflectFromReflect>(type_id)
      .unwrap();
    
    // Call `FromReflect::from_reflect` on our Dynamic value
    let concrete_value: Box<dyn Reflect> = rfr.from_reflect(&dynamic_value);
    assert!(concrete_value.is::<MyStruct>());
    ```
    
    ### Why this PR?
    
    ###### Why now?
    
    The three main reasons I closed #4147 were that:
    
    1. Registering `ReflectFromReflect` is clunky (deriving `FromReflect` *and* registering `ReflectFromReflect`)
    2. The ecosystem and Bevy itself didn't seem to pay much attention to deriving `FromReflect`
    3. I didn't see a lot of desire from the community for such a feature
    
    However, as time has passed it seems 2 and 3 are not really true anymore. Bevy is internally adding lots more `FromReflect` derives, which should make this feature all the more useful. Additionally, I have seen a growing number of people look for something like `ReflectFromReflect`.
    
    I think 1 is still an issue, but not a horrible one. Plus it could be made much, much better using #6056. And I think splitting this feature out of #6056 could lead to #6056 being adopted sooner (or at least make the need more clear to users).
    
    ###### Why not just re-open #4147?
    
    The main reason is so that this PR can garner more attention than simply re-opening the old one. This helps bring fresh eyes to the PR for potentially more perspectives/reviews.

    Derive `Reflect` + `FromReflect` for window event types (#6235)
    
    # Objective
    
    The window event types currently don't support reflection. This PR adds support to them (as requested [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6223#issuecomment-1273852329)).
    
    ## Solution
    
    Implement `Reflect` + `FromReflect` for window event types. Relevant traits are also being reflected with `#[reflect(...)]` attributes.
    
    Additionally, this PR derives `Reflect` + `FromReflect` for `WindowDescriptor` and the types it depends on so that `CreateWindow` events can be fully manipulated through reflection.
    
    Finally, this PR adds `FromReflect` for `PathBuf` as a value type, which is needed for `FileDragAndDrop`.
    
    This adds the "glam" feature to the `bevy_reflect` dependency for package `bevy_window`. Since `bevy_window` transitively depends on `glam` already, all this brings in are the reflection `impl`s.
    
    ## Open questions
    
    Should `app.register_type::<PathBuf>();` be moved to `CorePlugin`? I added it to `WindowPlugin` because that's where it's used and `CorePlugin` doesn't seem to register all the missing std types, but it would also make sense in `CorePlugin` I believe since it's a commonly used type.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Added:
    - Implemented `Reflect` + `FromReflect` for window events and related types. These types are automatically registered when adding the `WindowPlugin`.

    ci: Use Ubuntu 22.04 runner for run-examples, run-examples-on-wasm jobs  (#6875)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The `run-examples-on-wasm` job fails on Ubuntu 22.04, when it was previously working on Ubuntu 20.04. Playwright 1.22.1 (the version currently pinned by us) fails trying to install system dependencies that were renamed between Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04.
    - The `run-examples` job previously failed on Ubuntu 22.04 with errors consistent with those listed in [this upstream mesa bug](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/7819).
    - Fixes #6832
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Upgrade `playwright` to the latest [v1.28.1](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.28.1) release. Ubuntu 22.04 support was [added](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/14588) in [v1.23.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.23.0). The [test now passes on 22.04](https://github.com/oliviacrain/bevy/actions/runs/3633583112/jobs/6130757397), and the output screenshots are unchanged from previous job outputs.
    - Use `ubuntu-latest` for the `run-examples` job. No other modifications necessary. The [PPA we pull mesa from](https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/graphics-drivers) rebuilt the package for 22.04 with the [upstream fix](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20145/diffs?commit_id=b3d1ae19f2f4d93cf0a5f45a598149ac4e8e05aa).

    remove a `doc(hidden)` on read only version of `derive(WorldQuery)` (#6877)
    
    having `doc(hidden)` on the read only version of a generated mutable world query leads to docs on the readonly item having a dead link. It also makes it annoying to have nice docs for libraries attempting to expose derived `WorldQuery` structs as re-exporting the read only item does not cause it to appear in docs even though it would be intended for users to know about the read only world query and use it.

    Prevent future unsoundness that was seen in #6623.
    
    ## Solution
    Newtype both indexes in `Archetype` and `Table` as `ArchetypeRow` and `TableRow`. This avoids weird numerical manipulation on the indices, and can be stored and treated opaquely. Also enforces the source and destination of where these indices at a type level.

    Use T::Storage::STORAGE_TYPE to optimize out unused branches (#6800)
    
    # Objective
    `EntityRef::get` and friends all type erase calls to fetch the target components by using passing in the `TypeId` instead of using generics. This is forcing a lookup to `Components` to fetch the storage type. This adds an extra memory lookup and forces a runtime branch instead of allowing the compiler to optimize out the unused branch.
    
    ## Solution
    Leverage `Component::Storage::STORAGE_TYPE` as a constant instead of fetching the metadata from `Components`.
    
    ## Performance
    This has a near 2x speedup for all calls to `World::get`. Microbenchmark results from my local machine. `Query::get_component`, which uses `EntityRef::get` internally also show a slight speed up. This has closed the gap between `World::get` and `Query::get` for the same use case.

    Remove unnecessary alternate create_texture path in prepare_asset for Image (#6671)
    
    # Objective
    
    `prepare_asset` for Image has an alternate path for texture creation that is used when the image is not compressed and does not contain mipmaps. This additional code path is unnecessary as `render_device.create_texture_with_data()` will handle both cases correctly.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use `render_device.create_texture_with_data()` in all cases.
    
    Tested successfully with the following examples:
    - load_gltf
    - render_to_texture
    - texture
    - 3d_shapes
    - sprite
    - sprite_sheet
    - array_texture
    - shader_material_screenspace_texture
    - skybox (though this already would use the `create_texture_with_data()` branch anyway)

    Borrow instead of consuming in `EventReader::clear` (#6851)
    
    The PR fixes the interface of `EventReader::clear`. Currently, the method consumes the reader, which makes it unusable.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `EventReader::clear` now takes a mutable reference instead of consuming the event reader.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `EventReader::clear` now takes a mutable reference instead of consuming the event reader. This means that `clear` now needs explicit mutable access to the reader variable, which previously could have been omitted in some cases:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (0.9)
    fn clear_events(reader: EventReader<SomeEvent>) {
      reader.clear();
    }
    
    // New (0.10)
    fn clear_events(mut reader: EventReader<SomeEvent>) {
      reader.clear();
    }
    ```

    Currently, the `SystemParam` derive forces you to declare the lifetime parameters `<'w, 's>`, even if you don't use them.
    If you don't follow this structure, the error message is quite nasty.
    
    ### Example (before):
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(SystemParam)]
    pub struct EventWriter<'w, 's, E: Event> {
        events: ResMut<'w, Events<E>>,
        // The derive forces us to declare the `'s` lifetime even though we don't use it,
        // so we have to add this `PhantomData` to please rustc.
        #[system_param(ignore)]
        _marker: PhantomData<&'s ()>,
    }
    ```
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    * Allow the user to omit either lifetime.
    * Emit a descriptive error if any lifetimes used are invalid.
    
    ### Example (after):
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(SystemParam)]
    pub struct EventWriter<'w, E: Event> {
        events: ResMut<'w, Events<E>>,
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * The `SystemParam` derive is now more flexible, allowing you to omit unused lifetime parameters.

    bevy_reflect: Fix misplaced impls (#6829)
    
    # Objective
    
    > Followup to [this](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/6755#discussion_r1032671178) comment
    
    Rearrange the impls in the `impls/std.rs` file.
    
    The issue was that I had accidentally misplaced the impl for `Option<T>` and put it between the `Cow<'static, str>` impls. This is just a slight annoyance and readability issue.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Move the `Option<T>` and `&'static Path` impls around to be more readable.

    Add note about global `.gitignore` to `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Instead of ignoring `.DS_Store` files created by macOS Finder (#6499)
    
    # Objective
    
    Finder in macOS creates hidden `.DS_Store` files containing metadata (for icon positioning, view mode, etc) whenever you browse a directory. There's no point in committing these to git, and they're a common git + macOS nuisance.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - ~~This PR adds `.DS_Store` files to `.gitignore`, improving the developer experience on macOS.~~
    - This PR adds a note to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file teaching how to use global git ignore.

    Lock down access to Entities (#6740)
    
    # Objective
    The soundness of the ECS `World` partially relies on the correctness of the state of `Entities` stored within it. We're currently allowing users to (unsafely) mutate it, as well as readily construct it without using a `World`. While this is not strictly unsound so long as users (including `bevy_render`) safely use the APIs, it's a fairly easy path to unsoundness without much of a guard rail.
    
    Addresses #3362 for `bevy_ecs::entity`. Incorporates the changes from #3985.
    
    ## Solution
    Remove `Entities`'s  `Default` implementation and force access to the type to only be through a properly constructed `World`.
    
    Additional cleanup for other parts of `bevy_ecs::entity`:
    
     - `Entity::index` and `Entity::generation` are no longer `pub(crate)`, opting to force the rest of bevy_ecs to use the public interface to access these values.
     - `EntityMeta` is no longer `pub` and also not `pub(crate)` to attempt to cut down on updating `generation` without going through an `Entities` API. It's currently inaccessible except via the `pub(crate)` Vec on `Entities`, there was no way for an outside user to use it.
     - Added `Entities::set`, an unsafe `pub(crate)` API for setting the location of an Entity (parallel to `Entities::get`) that replaces the internal case where we need to set the location of an entity when it's been spawned, moved, or despawned.
     - `Entities::alloc_at_without_replacement` is only used in `World::get_or_spawn` within the first party crates, and I cannot find a public use of this API in any ecosystem crate that I've checked (via GitHub search).
     - Attempted to document the few remaining undocumented public APIs in the module.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Removed: `Entities`'s `Default` implementation.
    Removed: `EntityMeta`
    Removed: `Entities::alloc_at_without_replacement` and `AllocAtWithoutReplacement`.

    # Objective
    Document `bevy_ecs::archetype` and and declutter the public documentation for the module by making types non-`pub`.
    
    Addresses #3362 for `bevy_ecs::archetype`.
    
    ## Solution
     - Add module level documentation.
     - Add type and API level documentation for all public facing types.
     - Make `ArchetypeId`, `ArchetypeGeneration`, and `ArchetypeComponentId` truly opaque IDs that are not publicly constructable.
     - Make `AddBundle` non-pub, make `Edges::get_add_bundle` return a `Option<ArchetypeId>` and fork the existing function into `Edges::get_add_bundle_internal`.
     - Remove `pub(crate)` on fields that have a corresponding pub accessor function.
     - Removed the `Archetypes: Default` impl, opting for a `pub(crate) fn new` alternative instead.

    ## Changelog
    Added: `ArchetypeGeneration` now implements `Ord` and `PartialOrd`.

    Removed: `ArchetypeId::new` and `ArchetypeId::value`.
    Removed: `ArchetypeGeneration::value`
    Removed: `ArchetypeIdentity`.
    Removed: `ArchetypeComponentId::new` and `ArchetypeComponentId::value`.
    Removed: `AddBundle`. `Edges::get_add_bundle` now returns `Option<ArchetypeId>`

    One of the use-cases for the function `Entity::from_raw` is creating placeholder entity ids, which are meant to be overwritten later. If we use a constant for this instead of `from_raw`, it is more ergonomic and self-documenting.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a constant that returns an entity ID with an index of `u32::MAX` and a generation of zero. Users are instructed to overwrite this value before using it.

    When a global tracing subscriber has already been set, `LogPlugin` panics with an error message explaining this. However, if a global logger has already been set, it simply panics on an unwrap.
    
    #6426 mentiones the panic and has been fixed by unique plugins, but the panic can still occur if a logger has been set through different means or multiple apps are created, as in  #4934. The solution to that specific case isn't clear; this PR only fixes the missing error message.

    - ~add error message to panic~

    Remove unnecessary struct in Material AsBindGroup example (#6701)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Reduce confusion around uniform bindings in materials. I've seen multiple people on discord get confused by it because it uses a struct that is named the same in the rust code and the wgsl code, but doesn't contain the same data. Also, the only reason this works is mostly by chance because the memory happens to align correctly.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the confusing parts of the doc
    
    ## Notes
    
    It's not super clear in the diff why this causes confusion, but essentially, the rust code defines a `CustomMaterial` struct with a color and a texture, but in the wgsl code the struct with the same name only contains the color. People are confused by it because the struct in wgsl doesn't need to be there.
    
    You _can_ have complex structs on each side and the macro will even combine it for you if you reuse a binding index, but as it is now, this example seems to confuse more than help people.

    # Objective
    
    - `PathBuf` and `OsString` not reflected correctly.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add missing registrations.
    - Add FromReflect impls.
    - Always implement `Reflect` for `OsString` just skip `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for unsupported platforms.

    Fix set_cursor_grab_mode to try an alternative mode before giving an error (#6599)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Closes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6590
    - The grab mode is platform dependent, this is problematic for bevy users since we can't easily use the recommended way to detect if the feature works like the winit docs recommend https://docs.rs/winit/0.27.5/winit/window/struct.Window.html#method.set_cursor_grab
    
    ## Solution
    
    Try to use the grab mode that was requested, if it fails use the other one. Only then log an error if it fails after this step.

    Warn instead of erroring when max_font_atlases is exceeded (#6673)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6642
    
    In a way that doesn't create any breaking changes, as a possible way to fix the above in a patch release.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Don't actually remove font atlases when `max_font_atlases` is exceeded. Add a warning instead.
    
    Keep `TextError::ExceedMaxTextAtlases` and `TextSettings` as-is so we don't break anything.
    
    This is a bit of a cop-out, but the problems revealed by #6642 seem very challenging to fix properly.
    
    Maybe follow up later with something more like https://github.com/rparrett/bevy/commits/remove-max-font-atlases later, if this is the direction we want to go.

    bevy_reflect: Remove `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` registrations from most glam types (#6580)
    
    # Objective
    
    > Part of #6573
    
    When serializing a `DynamicScene` we end up treating almost all non-value types as though their type data doesn't exist. This is because when creating the `DynamicScene` we call `Reflect::clone_value` on the components, which generates a Dynamic type for all non-value types.
    
    What this means is that the `glam` types are treated as though their `ReflectSerialize` registrations don't exist. However, the deserializer _does_ pick up the registration and attempts to use that instead. This results in the deserializer trying to operate on "malformed" data, causing this error:
    
    ```
    WARN bevy_asset::asset_server: encountered an error while loading an asset: Expected float
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Ideally, we should better handle the serialization of possibly-Dynamic types. However, this runs into issues where the `ReflectSerialize` expects the concrete type and not a Dynamic representation, resulting in a panic:
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/0aa4147af6d583c707863484d6a8ad50ed0ed984/crates/bevy_reflect/src/type_registry.rs#L402-L413
    
    Since glam types are so heavily used in Bevy (specifically in `Transform` and `GlobalTransform`), it makes sense to just a quick fix in that enables them to be used properly in scenes while a proper solution is found.
    
    This PR simply removes all `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` registrations from the glam types that are reflected as structs.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Remove `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` registrations from most glam types
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    This PR removes `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` registrations from most glam types. This means any code relying on either of those type data existing for those glam types will need to not do that.
    
    This also means that some serialized glam types will need to be updated. For example, here is `Affine3A`:
    
    ```rust
    // BEFORE
    (
      "glam::f32::affine3a::Affine3A": (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    
    // AFTER
      "glam::f32::affine3a::Affine3A": (
        matrix3: (
          x_axis: (
            x: 1.0,
            y: 0.0,
            z: 0.0,
          ),
          y_axis: (
            x: 0.0,
            y: 1.0,
            z: 0.0,
          ),
          z_axis: (
            x: 0.0,
            y: 0.0,
            z: 1.0,
          ),
        ),
        translation: (
          x: 0.0,
          y: 0.0,
          z: 0.0,
        ),

    bevy_reflect: Register missing reflected types for `bevy_render` (#6725)
    
    # Objective
    
    Many types in `bevy_render` implemented `Reflect` but were not registered.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Register all types in `bevy_render` that impl `Reflect`.
    
    This also registers additional dependent types (i.e. field types).
    
    > Note: Adding these dependent types would not be needed using something like #5781 😉
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Register missing `bevy_render` types in the `TypeRegistry`:
      - `camera::RenderTarget`
      - `globals::GlobalsUniform`
      - `texture::Image`
      - `view::ComputedVisibility`
      - `view::Visibility`
      - `view::VisibleEntities`
    - Register additional dependent types:
      - `view::ComputedVisibilityFlags`
      - `Vec<Entity>`

    await tasks to cancel (#6696)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6603
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `Task`s will cancel when dropped, but wait until they return Pending before they actually get canceled. That means that if a task panics, it's possible for that error to get propagated to the scope and the scope gets dropped, while scoped tasks in other threads are still running. This is a big problem since scoped task can hold life-timed values that are dropped as the scope is dropped leading to UB.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - changed `Scope` to use `FallibleTask` and await the cancellation of all remaining tasks when it's dropped.

    reading from the `EventReader` more often (generally the best
    solution) or calling Events::update() less frequently
    (normally this is called once per frame). This problem is most
    likely due to run criteria/fixed timesteps or consuming events
    conditionally. See the Events documentation for
    more information.
    
    when you miss events. These warnings were often (but not always) a false positive. You can still check this manually by using `ManualEventReader::missed_events`

    Remove `BuildWorldChildren` impl from `WorldChildBuilder` (#6727)
    
    # Objective
    Remove an obscure and inconsistent bit of API.
    Simplify the `WorldChildBuilder` code.
    
    No idea why this even exists.
    
    An example of the removed API:
    ```rust
    world.spawn_empty().with_children(|parent| {
        parent.spawn_empty();
        parent.push_children(&[some_entity]); // Does *not* add children to the parent.
        // It's actually identical to:
        parent.spawn_empty().push_children(&[some_entity]);
    });
    
    world.spawn_empty().with_children(|parent| {
        // This just panics.
        parent.push_children(&[some_entity]);
    });
    ```
    This exists only on `WorldChildBuilder`; `ChildBuilder` does not have this API.
    
    Yeet.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Hierarchy editing methods such as `with_children` and `push_children` have been removed from `WorldChildBuilder`.
    You can edit the hierarchy via `EntityMut` instead.

    bevy_reflect: Fix binary deserialization not working for unit structs (#6722)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6713
    
    Binary deserialization is failing for unit structs as well as structs with all ignored/skipped fields.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a check for the number of possible fields in a struct before deserializing. If empty, don't attempt to deserialize any fields (as there will be none).
    
    Note: ~~This does not apply to enums as they do not properly handle skipped fields (see #6721).~~ Enums still do not properly handle skipped fields, but I decided to include the logic for it anyways to account for `#[reflect(ignore)]`'d fields in the meantime.

    fix mutable aliases for a very short time if `WorldCell` is already borrowed (#6639)
    
    # Objective
    
    Consider the test
    ```rust
    let cell = world.cell();
    let _value_a = cell.resource_mut::<A>();
    let _value_b = cell.resource_mut::<A>();
    ```
    
    Currently, this will roughly execute
    
    ```rust
    // first call
    let value = unsafe {
        self.world
        .get_non_send_unchecked_mut_with_id(component_id)?
    };
    return Some(WorldBorrowMut::new(value, archetype_component_id, self.access)))
    
    // second call
    let value = unsafe {
        self.world
        .get_non_send_unchecked_mut_with_id(component_id)?
    };
    return Some(WorldBorrowMut::new(value, archetype_component_id, self.access)))
    ```
    where `WorldBorrowMut::new` will panic if the resource is already borrowed.
    
    This means, that `_value_a` will be created, the access checked (OK), then `value_b` will be created, and the access checked (`panic`).
    For a moment, both `_value_a` and `_value_b` existed as `&mut T` to the same location, which is insta-UB as far as I understand it.
    
    ## Solution
    Flip the order so that `WorldBorrowMut::new` first checks the access, _then_ fetches creates the value. To do that, we pass a `impl FnOnce() -> Mut<T>` instead of the `Mut<T>` directly:
    
    ```rust
    let get_value = || unsafe {
        self.world
        .get_non_send_unchecked_mut_with_id(component_id)?
    };
    return Some(WorldBorrowMut::new(get_value, archetype_component_id, self.access)))
    ```

    Add try_* to add_slot_edge, add_node_edge (#6720)
    
    # Objective
    
    `add_node_edge` and `add_slot_edge` are fallible methods, but are always used with `.unwrap()`.
    `input_node` is often unwrapped as well.
    This points to having an infallible behaviour as default, with an alternative fallible variant if needed.
    
    Improves readability and ergonomics.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Change `add_node_edge` and `add_slot_edge` to panic on error.
    - Change `input_node` to panic on `None`.
    - Add `try_add_node_edge` and `try_add_slot_edge` in case fallible methods are needed.
    - Add `get_input_node` to still be able to get an `Option`.

    - `add_node_edge` is now infallible (panics on error)
    - `add_slot_edge` is now infallible (panics on error)
    - `input_node` now panics on `None`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Remove `.unwrap()` from `add_node_edge` and `add_slot_edge`.
    For cases where the error was handled, use `try_add_node_edge` and `try_add_slot_edge` instead.
    
    Remove `.unwrap()` from `input_node`.
    For cases where the option was handled, use `get_input_node` instead.

Transform propagation is a strict dependency for anything positioned in world-space. In large worlds, this can take quite a bit of time, so limiting it to a single thread can result in poor CPU utilization as it bottlenecks the rest of the frame's systems.
    
    ## Solution
    
     - Move transforms without a parent or a child (free-floating (Global)Transform) entities into a separate parallel system.
     - Chunk the hierarchy based on the root entities and process it in parallel with `Query::par_for_each_mut`.
     - Utilize the hierarchy's specific properties introduced in #4717 to allow for safe use of `Query::get_unchecked` on multiple threads. Assuming each child is unique in the hierarchy, it is impossible to have an aliased `&mut GlobalTransform` so long as we verify that the parent for a child is the same one propagated from.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Removed: `transform_propagate_system` is no longer `pub`.

    Fix PipeSystem panicking with exclusive systems (#6698)
    
    Without this fix, piped systems containing exclusive systems fail to run, giving a runtime panic.
    With this PR, running piped systems that contain exclusive systems now works.
    
    ## Explanation of the bug
    
    This is because, unless overridden, the default implementation of `run` from the `System` trait simply calls `run_unsafe`. That is not valid for exclusive systems. They must always be called via `run`, as `run_unsafe` takes `&World` instead of `&mut World`.
    
    Trivial reproduction example:
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        App::new()
            .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
            .add_system(exclusive.pipe(another))
            .run();
    }
    
    fn exclusive(_world: &mut World) {}
    fn another() {}
    ```
    If you run this, you will get a panic 'Cannot run exclusive systems with a shared World reference' and the backtrace shows how bevy (correctly) tries to call the `run` method (because the system is exclusive), but it is the implementation from the `System` trait (because `PipeSystem` does not have its own), which calls `run_unsafe` (incorrect):
     - 3: <bevy_ecs::system::system_piping::PipeSystem<SystemA,SystemB> as bevy_ecs::system::system::System>::run_unsafe
     - 4: bevy_ecs::system::system::System::run

    ExtractComponent output optional associated type (#6699)
    
    # Objective
    
    Allow more use cases where the user may benefit from both `ExtractComponentPlugin` _and_ `UniformComponentPlugin`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add an associated type to `ExtractComponent` in order to allow specifying the output component (or bundle).
    
    Make `extract_component` return an `Option<_>` such that components can be extracted only when needed.
    
    What problem does this solve?
    
    `ExtractComponentPlugin` allows extracting components, but currently the output type is the same as the input.
    This means that use cases such as having a settings struct which turns into a uniform is awkward.
    
    For example we might have:
    
    ```rust
    struct MyStruct {
        enabled: bool,
        val: f32
    }
    
    struct MyStructUniform {
        val: f32
    }
    ```
    
    With the new approach, we can extract `MyStruct` only when it is enabled, and turn it into its related uniform.
    
    This chains well with `UniformComponentPlugin`.
    
    The user may then:
    
    ```rust
    app.add_plugin(ExtractComponentPlugin::<MyStruct>::default());
    app.add_plugin(UniformComponentPlugin::<MyStructUniform>::default());
    ```
    
    This then saves the user a fair amount of boilerplate.
    
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - `ExtractComponent` can specify output type, and outputting is optional.

    Expose set_cursor_hittest() from winit (#6664)

    - Bevy should be usable to create 'overlay' type apps, where the input is not captured by Bevy, but passed down/into a target app, or to allow passive displays/widgets etc.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - the `winit::window::Window` already has a `set_cursor_hittest()` which basically does this for mouse input events, so I've exposed it (trying to copy the style laid out in the existing wrappings, and added a simple demo.

    Split Component Ticks (#6547)
    
    # Objective
    Fixes #4884. `ComponentTicks` stores both added and changed ticks contiguously in the same 8 bytes. This is convenient when passing around both together, but causes half the bytes fetched from memory for the purposes of change detection to effectively go unused. This is inefficient when most queries (no filter, mutating *something*) only write out to the changed ticks.
    
    ## Solution
    Split the storage for change detection ticks into two separate `Vec`s inside `Column`. Fetch only what is needed during iteration.
    
    This also potentially also removes one blocker from autovectorization of dense queries.
    
    EDIT: This is confirmed to enable autovectorization of dense queries in `for_each` and `par_for_each`  where possible.  Unfortunately `iter` has other blockers that prevent it.
    
    ### TODO
    
     - [x] Microbenchmark
     - [x] Check if this allows query iteration to autovectorize simple loops.
     - [x] Clean up all of the spurious tuples now littered throughout the API
    
    ### Open Questions
    
     - ~~Is `Mut::is_added` absolutely necessary? Can we not just use `Added` or `ChangeTrackers`?~~ It's optimized out if unused.
     - ~~Does the fetch of the added ticks get optimized out if not used?~~ Yes it is.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Added: `Tick`, a wrapper around a single change detection tick.
    Added: `Column::get_added_ticks`
    Added: `Column::get_column_ticks`
    Added: `SparseSet::get_added_ticks`
    Added: `SparseSet::get_column_ticks`
    Changed: `Column` now stores added and changed ticks separately internally.
    Changed: Most APIs returning `&UnsafeCell<ComponentTicks>` now returns `TickCells` instead, which contains two separate `&UnsafeCell<Tick>` for either component ticks.
    Changed: `Query::for_each(_mut)`, `Query::par_for_each(_mut)` will now leverage autovectorization to speed up query iteration where possible.

    Use the solution mentioned in the issue by catching the unwind and dropping the error. Wrap the `executor.try_tick` calls with `std::catch::unwind`.
    
    Ideally this would be moved outside of the hot loop, but the mut ref to the `spawned` future is not `UnwindSafe`.

    improve compile time by type-erasing wgpu structs (#5950)
    
    # Objective
    
    structs containing wgpu types take a long time to compile. this is particularly bad for generics containing the wgpu structs (like the depth pipeline builder with `#[derive(SystemParam)]` i've been working on).
    
    we can avoid that by boxing and type-erasing in the bevy `render_resource` wrappers.
    
    type system magic is not a strength of mine so i guess there will be a cleaner way to achieve this, happy to take feedback or for it to be taken as a proof of concept if someone else wants to do a better job.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - add macros to box and type-erase in debug mode
    - leave current impl for release mode

    Replace BlobVec's swap_scratch with a swap_nonoverlapping (#4853)
    
    # Objective
    BlobVec currently relies on a scratch piece of memory allocated at initialization to make a temporary copy of a component when using `swap_remove_and_{forget/drop}`. This is potentially suboptimal as it writes to a, well-known, but random part of memory instead of using the stack.
    
    ## Solution
    As the `FIXME` in the file states, replace `swap_scratch` with a call to `swap_nonoverlapping::<u8>`. The swapped last entry is returned as a `OwnedPtr`.
    
    In theory, this should be faster as the temporary swap is allocated on the stack, `swap_nonoverlapping` allows for easier vectorization for bigger types, and the same memory is used between the swap and the returned `OwnedPtr`.

    Fix FilteredAccessSet get_conflicts inconsistency (#5105)
    
    # Objective
    
    * Enable `Res` and `Query` parameter mutual exclusion
    * Required for https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5080
    
    The `FilteredAccessSet::get_conflicts` methods didn't work properly with
    `Res` and `ResMut` parameters. Because those added their access by using
    the `combined_access_mut` method and directly modifying the global
    access state of the FilteredAccessSet. This caused an inconsistency,
    because get_conflicts assumes that ALL added access have a corresponding
    `FilteredAccess` added to the `filtered_accesses` field.
    
    In practice, that means that SystemParam that adds their access through
    the `Access` returned by `combined_access_mut` and the ones that add
    their access using the `add` method lived in two different universes. As
    a result, they could never be mutually exclusive.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This commit fixes it by removing the `combined_access_mut` method. This
    ensures that the `combined_access` field of FilteredAccessSet is always
    updated consistently with the addition of a filter. When checking for
    filtered access, it is now possible to account for `Res` and `ResMut`
    invalid access. This is currently not needed, but might be in the
    future.
    
    We add the `add_unfiltered_{read,write}` methods to replace previous
    usages of `combined_access_mut`.
    
    We also add improved Debug implementations on FixedBitSet so that their
    meaning is much clearer in debug output.
    
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Fix `Res` and `Query` parameter never being mutually exclusive.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Note: this mostly changes ECS internals, but since the API is public, it is technically breaking:
    * Removed `FilteredAccessSet::combined_access_mut`
      * Replace _immutable_ usage of those by `combined_access`
      * For _mutable_ usages, use the new `add_unfiltered_{read,write}` methods instead of `combined_access_mut` followed by `add_{read,write}`

    Immutable sparse sets for metadata storage (#4928)
    
    # Objective
    Make core types in ECS smaller. The column sparse set in Tables is never updated after creation.
    
    ## Solution
    Create `ImmutableSparseSet` which removes the capacity fields in the backing vec's and the APIs for inserting or removing elements. Drops the size of the sparse set by 3 usizes (24 bytes on 64-bit systems)
    
    ## Followup
    ~~After #4809, Archetype's component SparseSet should be replaced with it.~~ This has been done.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Removed: `Table::component_capacity`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    `Table::component_capacity()` has been removed as Tables do not support adding/removing columns after construction.

    Remove redundant table and sparse set component IDs from Archetype (#4927)
    
    # Objective
    Archetype is a deceptively large type in memory. It stores metadata about which components are in which storage in multiple locations, which is only used when creating new Archetypes while moving entities.
    
    ## Solution
    Remove the redundant `Box<[ComponentId]>`s and iterate over the sparse set of component metadata instead. Reduces Archetype's size by 4 usizes (32 bytes on 64-bit systems), as well as the additional allocations for holding these slices.
    
    It'd seem like there's a downside that the origin archetype has it's component metadata iterated over twice when creating a new archetype, but this change also removes the extra `Vec<ArchetypeComponentId>` allocations when creating a new archetype which may amortize out to a net gain here. This change likely negatively impacts creating new archetypes with a large number of components, but that's a cost mitigated by the fact that these archetypal relationships are cached in Edges and is incurred only once for each edge created.
    
    ## Additional Context
    There are several other in-flight PRs that shrink Archetype:
    
     - #4800 merges the entities and rows Vecs together (shaves off 24 bytes per archetype)
     - #4809 removes unique_components and moves it to it's own dedicated storage (shaves off 72 bytes per archetype)
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Changed: `Archetype::table_components` and `Archetype::sparse_set_components` return iterators instead of slices. `Archetype::new` requires iterators instead of parallel slices/vecs.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Do I still need to do this? I really hope people were not relying on the public facing APIs changed here.

    Shrink ComputedVisibility (#6305)
    
    # Objective
    `ComputedVisibility` could afford to be smaller/faster. Optimizing the size and performance of operations on the component will positively benefit almost all extraction systems.
    
    This was listed as one of the potential pieces of future work for #5310.
    
    ## Solution
    Merge both internal booleans into a single `u8` bitflag field. Rely on bitmasks to evaluate local, hierarchical, and general visibility.
    
    Pros:
    
     - `ComputedVisibility::is_visible` should be a single bitmask test instead of two.
     - `ComputedVisibility` is now only 1 byte. Should be able to fit 100% more per cache line when using dense iteration.
    
    Cons:
    
     - Harder to read.
     - Setting individual values inside `ComputedVisiblity` require bitmask mutations.
    
    This should be a non-breaking change. No public API was changed. The only publicly visible effect is that `ComputedVisibility` is now 1 byte instead of 2.

    Add safe constructors for untyped pointers `Ptr` and `PtrMut` (#6539)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, `Ptr` and `PtrMut` can only be constructed via unsafe code. This means that downgrading a reference to an untyped pointer is very cumbersome, despite being a very simple operation.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Define conversions for easily and safely constructing untyped pointers. This is the non-owned counterpart to `OwningPtr::make`.
    
    Before:
    
    ```rust
    let ptr = unsafe { PtrMut::new(NonNull::from(&mut value).cast()) };
    ```
    
    After:
    
    ```rust

    The [documentation for `ButtonSettingsError`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.9.0/bevy/input/gamepad/enum.ButtonSettingsError.html) incorrectly describes the valid range of values as `0.0..=2.0`, probably because it was copied from `AxisSettingsError`. The actual range, as seen in the functions that return it and in its own `thiserror` description, is `0.0..=1.0`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Update the doc comments to reflect the correct range.

    Fix instancing example for hdr (#6554)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Using the instancing example as reference, I found it was breaking when enabling HDR on the camera. I found that this was because, unlike in internal code, this was not updating the specialization key with `view.hdr`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add the missing HDR bit.

    Ignore `Timeout` errors on Linux AMD & Intel (#5957)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fix #3606
    - Fix #4579
    - Fix #3380
    
    ## Solution
    
    When running on a Linux machine with some AMD or Intel device, when calling
    `surface.get_current_texture()`, ignore `wgpu::SurfaceError::Timeout` errors.
    
    
    ## Alternative
    
    An alternative solution found in the `wgpu` examples is:
    
    ```rust
    let frame = surface
        .get_current_texture()
        .or_else(|_| {
            render_device.configure_surface(surface, &swap_chain_descriptor);
            surface.get_current_texture()
        })
        .expect("Error reconfiguring surface");
    window.swap_chain_texture = Some(TextureView::from(frame));
    ```
    
    See: <https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/94ce76391b560a66e36df1300bd684321e57511a/wgpu/examples/framework.rs#L362-L370>
    
    Veloren [handles the Timeout error the way this PR proposes to handle it](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/1218#issuecomment-1092056971).
    
    The reason I went with this PR's solution is that `configure_surface` seems to be quite an expensive operation, and it would run every frame with the wgpu framework solution, despite the fact it works perfectly fine without `configure_surface`.
    
    I know this looks super hacky with the linux-specific line and the AMD check, but my understanding is that the `Timeout` occurrence is specific to a quirk of some AMD drivers on linux, and if otherwise met should be considered a bug.

    Fix color banding by dithering image before quantization (#5264)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Closes #5262
    - Fix color banding caused by quantization.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Adds dithering to the tonemapping node from #3425.
    - This is inspired by Godot's default "debanding" shader: https://gist.github.com/belzecue/
    - Unlike Godot:
      - debanding happens after tonemapping. My understanding is that this is preferred, because we are running the debanding at the last moment before quantization (`[f32, f32, f32, f32]` -> `f32`). This ensures we aren't biasing the dithering strength by applying it in a different (linear) color space.
      - This code instead uses and reference the origin source, Valve at GDC 2015

    ## Additional Notes
    
    Real time rendering to standard dynamic range outputs is limited to 8 bits of depth per color channel. Internally we keep everything in full 32-bit precision (`vec4<f32>`) inside passes and 16-bit between passes until the image is ready to be displayed, at which point the GPU implicitly converts our `vec4<f32>` into a single 32bit value per pixel, with each channel (rgba) getting 8 of those 32 bits.
    
    ### The Problem
    
    8 bits of color depth is simply not enough precision to make each step invisible - we only have 256 values per channel! Human vision can perceive steps in luma to about 14 bits of precision. When drawing a very slight gradient, the transition between steps become visible because with a gradient, neighboring pixels will all jump to the next "step" of precision at the same time.
    
    ### The Solution
    
    One solution is to simply output in HDR - more bits of color data means the transition between bands will become smaller. However, not everyone has hardware that supports 10+ bit color depth. Additionally, 10 bit color doesn't even fully solve the issue, banding will result in coherent bands on shallow gradients, but the steps will be harder to perceive.
    
    The solution in this PR adds noise to the signal before it is "quantized" or resampled from 32 to 8 bits. Done naively, it's easy to add unneeded noise to the image. To ensure dithering is correct and absolutely minimal, noise is adding *within* one step of the output color depth. When converting from the 32bit to 8bit signal, the value is rounded to the nearest 8 bit value (0 - 255). Banding occurs around the transition from one value to the next, let's say from 50-51. Dithering will never add more than +/-0.5 bits of noise, so the pixels near this transition might round to 50 instead of 51 but will never round more than one step. This means that the output image won't have excess variance:
      - in a gradient from 49 to 51, there will be a step between each band at 49, 50, and 51.
      - Done correctly, the modified image of this gradient will never have a adjacent pixels more than one step (0-255) from each other.
      - I.e. when scanning across the gradient you should expect to see:
    ```
                      |-band-| |-band-| |-band-|
    Baseline:         49 49 49 50 50 50 51 51 51
    Dithered:         49 50 49 50 50 51 50 51 51
    Dithered (wrong): 49 50 51 49 50 51 49 51 50
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 14-12-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2632925/201219075-ab3f46be-d4e9-4869-b66b-a92e1706f49e.png)
    ![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 14-11-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2632925/201219079-ec5d2add-817d-487a-8fc1-84569c9cda73.png)
    
    
    
    
    You can see from above how correct dithering "fuzzes" the transition between bands to reduce distinct steps in color, without adding excess noise.
    
    ### HDR
    
    The previous section (and this PR) assumes the final output is to an 8-bit texture, however this is not always the case. When Bevy adds HDR support, the dithering code will need to take the per-channel depth into account instead of assuming it to be 0-255. Edit: I talked with Rob about this and it seems like the current solution is okay. We may need to revisit once we have actual HDR final image output.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    - All pipelines now support deband dithering. This is enabled by default in 3D, and can be toggled in the `Tonemapping` component in camera bundles. Banding is a graphical artifact created when the rendered image is crunched from high precision (f32 per color channel) down to the final output (u8 per channel in SDR). This results in subtle gradients becoming blocky due to the reduced color precision. Deband dithering applies a small amount of noise to the signal before it is "crunched", which breaks up the hard edges of blocks (bands) of color. Note that this does not add excess noise to the image, as the amount of noise is less than a single step of a color channel - just enough to break up the transition between color blocks in a gradient.

    bevy_pbr: Normalize skinned normals (#6543)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make the many foxes not unnecessarily bright. Broken since #5666.
    - Fixes #6528
    
    ## Solution
    
    - In #5666 normalisation of normals was moved from the fragment stage to the vertex stage. However, it was not added to the vertex stage for skinned normals. The many foxes are skinned and their skinned normals were not unit normals. which made them brighter. Normalising the skinned normals fixes this.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Fixed: Non-unit length skinned normals are now normalized.

    fix: explicitly specify required version of async-task (#6509)
    
    # Objective
    
    Attempting to build `bevy_tasks` produces the following error:
    
    ```
    error[E0599]: no method named `is_finished` found for struct `async_executor::Task` in the current scope
      --> /[...]]/bevy/crates/bevy_tasks/src/task.rs:51:16
       |
    51 |         self.0.is_finished()
       |                ^^^^^^^^^^^ method not found in `async_executor::Task<T>`
    
    ```
    
    It looks like this was introduced along with `Task::is_finished`, which delegates to `async_task::Task::is_finished`. However, the latter was only introduced in `async-task` 4.2.0; `bevy_tasks` does not explicitly depend on `async-task` but on `async-executor` ^1.3.0, which in turn depends on `async-task` ^4.0.0.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add an explicit dependency on `async-task` ^4.2.0.

    bevy_reflect: Add `Reflect::into_reflect` (#6502)
    
    # Objective
    
    Using `Reflect` we can easily switch between a specific reflection trait object, such as a `dyn Struct`, to a `dyn Reflect` object via `Reflect::as_reflect` or `Reflect::as_reflect_mut`.
    
    ```rust
    fn do_something(value: &dyn Reflect) {/* ... */}
    
    let foo: Box<dyn Struct> = Box::new(Foo::default());
    do_something(foo.as_reflect());
    ```
    
    However, there is no way to convert a _boxed_ reflection trait object to a `Box<dyn Reflect>`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a `Reflect::into_reflect` method which allows converting a boxed reflection trait object back into a boxed `Reflect` trait object.
    
    ```rust
    fn do_something(value: Box<dyn Reflect>) {/* ... */}

    do_something(foo.into_reflect());

    There is no way to gen an owned value of `Reflect`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add it! This was originally a part of #6421, but @MrGVSV asked me to create a separate for it to implement reflect diffing.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    - `Reflect::reflect_owned` to get an owned version of `Reflect`.

    Cleaning up NodeBundle, and some slight UI module re-organization (#6473)
    
    # Objective
    
    `NodeBundle` contains an `image` field, which can be misleading, because if you do supply an image there, nothing will be shown to screen. You need to use an `ImageBundle` instead.
    
    ## Solution
    
    * `image` (`UiImage`) field is removed from `NodeBundle`,
    * extraction stage queries now make an optional query for `UiImage`, if one is not found, use the image handle that is used as a default by `UiImage`: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c019a60b39c5683656025bc9d24a02744aa59dea/crates/bevy_ui/src/ui_node.rs#L464
    * touching up docs for `NodeBundle` to help guide what `NodeBundle` should be used for
    * renamed `entity.rs` to `node_bundle.rs` as that gives more of a hint regarding the module's purpose
    * separating `camera_config` stuff from the pre-made UI node bundles so that `node_bundle.rs` makes more sense as a module name.

    make `register` on `TypeRegistry` idempotent (#6487)
    
    # Objective
    
    - adding a new `.register` should not overwrite old type data
    - separate crates should both be able to register the same type
    
    I ran into this while debugging why `register::<Handle<T>>` removed the `ReflectHandle` type data from a prior `register_asset_reflect`.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - make `register` do nothing if called again for the same type
    - I also removed some unnecessary duplicate registrations

    `debug_checked_unwrap` should track its caller (#6452)
    
    # Objective
    
    When an error causes `debug_checked_unreachable` to be called, the panic message unhelpfully points to the function definition instead of the place that caused the error.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the `#[track_caller]` attribute in debug mode.

    UI scaling fix (#6479)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6466
    Summary: The UI Scaling example dynamically scales the UI which will dynamically allocate fonts to the font atlas surpassing the protective limit, throwing a panic.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Set TextSettings.allow_dynamic_font_size = true for the UI Scaling example. This is the ideal solution since the dynamic changes to the UI are not continuous yet still discrete.
    - Update the panic text to reflect ui scaling as a potential cause

    # Objective
    
    Bevy UI (and third party plugins) currently have no good way to position themselves after all post processing effects. They currently use the tonemapping node, but this is not adequate if there is anything after tonemapping (such as FXAA).
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a logical `END_MAIN_PASS_POST_PROCESSING` RenderGraph node that main pass post processing effects position themselves before, and things like UIs can position themselves after.

    Take DirectionalLight's GlobalTransform into account when calculating shadow map volume (not just direction) (#6384)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR fixes #5789, by enabling movable (and scalable) directional light shadow volumes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR changes `ExtractedDirectionalLight` to hold a copy of the `DirectionalLight` entity's `GlobalTransform`, instead of just a `direction` vector. This allows the shadow map volume (as defined by the light's `shadow_projection` field) to be transformed honoring translation _and_ scale transforms, and not just rotation.
    
    It also augments the texel size calculation (used to determine the `shadow_normal_bias`) so that it now takes into account the upper bound of the x/y/z scale of the `GlobalTransform`.
    
    This change makes the directional light extraction code more consistent with point and spot lights (that already use `transform`), and allows easily moving and scaling the shadow volume along with a player entity based on camera distance/angle, immediately enabling more real world use cases until we have a more sophisticated adaptive implementation, such as the one described in #3629.
    
    **Note:** While it was previously possible to update the projection achieving a similar effect, depending on the light direction and distance to the origin, the fact that the shadow map camera was always positioned at the origin with a hardcoded `Vec3::Y` up value meant you would get sub-optimal or inconsistent/incorrect results.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - `DirectionalLight` shadow volumes now honor translation and scale transforms
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - If your directional lights were positioned at the origin and not scaled (the default, most common scenario) no changes are needed on your part; it just works as before;
    - If you previously had a system for dynamically updating directional light shadow projections, you might now be able to simplify your code by updating the directional light entity's transform instead;
    - In the unlikely scenario that a scene with directional lights that previously rendered shadows correctly has missing shadows, make sure your directional lights are positioned at (0, 0, 0) and are not scaled to a size that's too large or too small.

    Fix unsound `EntityMut::remove_children`. Add `EntityMut::world_scope` (#6464)
    
    `EntityMut::remove_children` does not call `self.update_location()` which is unsound.
    Verified by adding the following assertion, which fails when running the tests.
    ```rust
    let before = self.location();
    self.update_location();
    assert_eq!(before, self.location());
    ```
    
    I also removed incorrect messages like "parent entity is not modified" and the unhelpful "Inserting a bundle in the children entities may change the parent entity's location if they were of the same archetype" which might lead people to think that's the *only* thing that can change the entity's location.

    Remove unnecesary branches/panics from Query accesses (#6461)
    
    # Objective
    Supercedes #6452. Upon inspection of the [generated assembly](https://gist.github.com/james7132/c2740c6941b80d7912f1e8888e223cbb#file-original-s) of a [simple Bevy binary](https://gist.github.com/james7132/c2740c6941b80d7912f1e8888e223cbb#file-source-rs) compiled with `cargo rustc --release -- --emit asm`, it's apparent that there are multiple unnecessary branches in the generated assembly:

            shlq    $4, %rdi
            movq    32(%rax,%rdi), %rdx
            movq    56(%rax,%rdi), %r8
            movq    8(%rbp,%rbx), %rbp
            leaq    (%rbp,%rbp,4), %rbp
            shlq    $4, %rbp
            movq    32(%rax,%rbp), %r9
            xorl    %ebp, %ebp
            jmp     .LBB5_13
            .p2align        4, 0x90
    ```
    
    Almost every one of the instructions starting with `j` is a potential branch, which can significantly slow down accesses. Of these, two labels are both common and never used:
    
    ```asm
    .LBB5_14:
            leaq    __unnamed_2(%rip), %r8
            callq   _ZN4core9panicking18panic_bounds_check17h70367088e72af65aE
            ud2
    .LBB5_4:
            callq   _ZN8bevy_ecs5query25debug_checked_unreachable17h0855ff520ceaea77E
            ud2
            .seh_endproc
    ```
    
    These correpsond to subprocedure calls to panicking due to out of bounds from indexing `Tables` and `debug_checked_unreadable`. Both of which should be inlined and optimized out, but are not.
    
    ## Solution
    Make `debug_checked_unreachable` a macro to forcibly inline either `unreachable!()` in debug builds, and `std::hint::unreachable_unchecked()` in release mode. Replace the `Tables` and `Archetype` index access with `get(id).unwrap_or_else(|| debug_checked_unreachable!())` to assume that the table or archetype provided exists.
    
    This has no external breaking change of any kind.
    
    The equivalent section of code with these changes removes most of the conditional jump instructions:
    
    ```asm
    .LBB5_5:
            movss   (%rbx,%rbp,4), %xmm0
            movl    %r14d, 4(%r8,%rbp,8)

            incq    %rbp
    .LBB5_1:
            cmpq    %rdx, %rbp
            jne     .LBB5_5
            .p2align        4, 0x90

    Allow passing `glam` vector types as vertex attributes (#6442)
    
    Allow passing `Vec`s of glam vector types as vertex attributes.
    Alternative to #4548 and #2719
    
    Also used some macros to cut down on all the repetition.
    
    # Migration Guide
    Implementations of `From<Vec<[u16; 4]>>` and `From<Vec<[u8; 4]>>` for `VertexAttributeValues` have been removed.
    I you're passing either `Vec<[u16; 4]>` or `Vec<[u8; 4]>` into `Mesh::insert_attribute` it will now require wrapping it with right the `VertexAttributeValues` enum variant.

    bevy_reflect: Binary formats (#6140)
    
    # Objective
    
    Closes #5934
    
    Currently it is not possible to de/serialize data to non-self-describing formats using reflection.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add support for non-self-describing de/serialization using reflection.
    
    This allows us to use binary formatters, like [`postcard`](https://crates.io/crates/postcard):
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect, FromReflect, Debug, PartialEq)]
    struct Foo {
      data: String
    }
    
    let mut registry = TypeRegistry::new();
    registry.register::<Foo>();
    
    let input = Foo {
      data: "Hello world!".to_string()
    };
    
    // === Serialize! === //
    let serializer = ReflectSerializer::new(&input, &registry);
    let bytes: Vec<u8> = postcard::to_allocvec(&serializer).unwrap();
    
    println!("{:?}", bytes); // Output: [129, 217, 61, 98, ...]
    
    // === Deserialize! === //
    let deserializer = UntypedReflectDeserializer::new(&registry);
    
    let dynamic_output = deserializer
      .deserialize(&mut postcard::Deserializer::from_bytes(&bytes))
      .unwrap();
    
    let output = <Foo as FromReflect>::from_reflect(dynamic_output.as_ref()).unwrap();
    
    assert_eq!(expected, output); // OK!
    ```
    
    #### Crates Tested
    
    - ~~[`rmp-serde`](https://crates.io/crates/rmp-serde)~~ Apparently, this _is_ self-describing
    - ~~[`bincode` v2.0.0-rc.1](https://crates.io/crates/bincode/2.0.0-rc.1) (using [this PR](https://github.com/bincode-org/bincode/pull/586))~~ This actually works for the latest release (v1.3.3) of [`bincode`](https://crates.io/crates/bincode) as well. You just need to be sure to use fixed-int encoding.
    - [`postcard`](https://crates.io/crates/postcard)
    
    ## Future Work
    
    Ideally, we would refactor the `serde` module, but I don't think I'll do that in this PR so as to keep the diff relatively small (and to avoid any painful rebases). This should probably be done once this is merged, though.
    
    Some areas we could improve with a refactor:
    
    * Split deserialization logic across multiple files
    * Consolidate helper functions/structs
    * Make the logic more DRY

    ## Changelog
    
    - Add support for non-self-describing de/serialization using reflection.

    Bloom (#6397)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Adds a bloom pass for HDR-enabled Camera3ds.
    - Supersedes (and all credit due to!) https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3430 and https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2876
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47158642/198698783-228edc00-20b5-4218-a613-331ccd474f38.png)
    
    ## Solution
    
    - A threshold is applied to isolate emissive samples, and then a series of downscale and upscaling passes are applied and composited together.
    - Bloom is applied to 2d or 3d Cameras with hdr: true and a BloomSettings component.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added a `core_pipeline::bloom::BloomSettings` component.
    - Added `BloomNode` that runs between the main pass and tonemapping.
    - Added a `BloomPlugin` that is loaded as part of CorePipelinePlugin.
    - Added a bloom example project.

    Fix spawning empty bundles (#6425)
    
    # Objective
    
    Alternative to #6424
    Fixes #6226
    
    Fixes spawning empty bundles
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add `BundleComponentStatus` trait and implement it for `AddBundle` and a new `SpawnBundleStatus` type (which always returns an Added status). `write_components` is now generic on `BundleComponentStatus` instead of taking `AddBundle` directly. This means BundleSpawner can now avoid needing AddBundle from the Empty archetype, which means BundleSpawner no longer needs a reference to the original archetype.
    
    In theory this cuts down on the work done in `write_components` when spawning, but I'm seeing no change in the spawn benchmarks.

    # Objective
    
    The UI pass in HDR breaks currently because the color attachment format does not match the HDR ViewTarget.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Specialize the UI pipeline on "hdr-ness" and select the appropriate format (like we do in the other built in pipelines).

    bevy_pbr: Fix incorrect and unnecessary normal-mapping code (#5766)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #4019
    - Fix lighting of double-sided materials when using a negative scale
    - The FlightHelmet.gltf model's hose uses a double-sided material. Loading the model with a uniform scale of -1.0, and comparing against Blender, it was identified that negating the world-space tangent, bitangent, and interpolated normal produces incorrect lighting. Discussion with Morten Mikkelsen clarified that this is both incorrect and unnecessary.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the code that negates the T, B, and N vectors (the interpolated world-space tangent, calculated world-space bitangent, and interpolated world-space normal) when seeing the back face of a double-sided material with negative scale.
    - Negate the world normal for a double-sided back face only when not using normal mapping

    `prepare_normal` from the `bevy_pbr::pbr_functions` shader import has been reworked.
    
    Before:
    ```rust
        pbr_input.world_normal = in.world_normal;
    
        pbr_input.N = prepare_normal(
            pbr_input.material.flags,
            in.world_normal,
    #ifdef VERTEX_TANGENTS
    #ifdef STANDARDMATERIAL_NORMAL_MAP
            in.world_tangent,
    #endif
    #endif
            in.uv,
            in.is_front,
        );
    ```
    
    After:
    ```rust
        pbr_input.world_normal = prepare_world_normal(
            in.world_normal,
            (material.flags & STANDARD_MATERIAL_FLAGS_DOUBLE_SIDED_BIT) != 0u,
            in.is_front,
        );
    
        pbr_input.N = apply_normal_mapping(
            pbr_input.material.flags,
            pbr_input.world_normal,
    #ifdef VERTEX_TANGENTS

    Increase the `MAX_DIRECTIONAL_LIGHTS` from 1 to 10 (#6066)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently we are limiting the amount of direction lights in a scene to one.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Increase the amount of direction lights from 1 to 10.
    This still is not a perfect solution, but should unblock many use cases.
    We could probably just store the directional lights similar to the point lights in an storage buffer, allowing for an variable amount of directional lights.

    TaskPool Panic Handling (#6443)
    
    # Objective
    Right now, the `TaskPool` implementation allows panics to permanently kill worker threads upon panicking. This is currently non-recoverable without using a `std::panic::catch_unwind` in every scheduled task. This is poor ergonomics and even poorer developer experience. This is exacerbated by #2250 as these threads are global and cannot be replaced after initialization.
    
    Removes the need for temporary fixes like #4998. Fixes #4996. Fixes #6081. Fixes #5285. Fixes #5054. Supersedes #2307.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The current solution is to wrap `Executor::run` in `TaskPool` with a `catch_unwind`, and discarding the potential panic. This was taken straight from [smol](https://github.com/smol-rs/smol/blob/404c7bcc0aea59b82d7347058043b8de7133241c/src/spawn.rs#L44)'s current implementation. ~~However, this is not entirely ideal as:~~
    
     - ~~the signaled to the awaiting task. We would need to change `Task<T>` to use `async_task::FallibleTask` internally, and even then it doesn't signal *why* it panicked, just that it did.~~ (See below).
     - ~~no error is logged of any kind~~ (See below)
     - ~~it's unclear if it drops other tasks in the executor~~ (it does not)
     - ~~This allows the ECS parallel executor to keep chugging even though a system's task has been dropped. This inevitably leads to deadlock in the executor.~~ Assuming we don't catch the unwind in ParallelExecutor, this will naturally kill the main thread.
    
    ### Alternatives
    A final solution likely will incorporate elements of any or all of the following.
    
    #### ~~Log and Ignore~~
    ~~Log the panic, drop the task, keep chugging. This only addresses the discoverability of the panic. The process will continue to run, probably deadlocking the executor. tokio's detatched tasks operate in this fashion.~~
    
    Panics already do this by default, even when caught by `catch_unwind`.
    
    #### ~~`catch_unwind` in `ParallelExecutor`~~
    ~~Add another layer catching system-level panics into the `ParallelExecutor`. How the executor continues when a core dependency of many systems fails to run is up for debate.~~
    
    `async_task::Task`  bubbles up panics already, this will transitively push panics all the way to the main thread.
    
    #### ~~Emulate/Copy `tokio::JoinHandle` with `Task<T>`~~
    ~~`tokio::JoinHandle<T>` bubbles up the panic from the underlying task when awaited. This can be transitively applied across other APIs that also use `Task<T>` like `Query::par_for_each` and `TaskPool::scope`, bubbling up the panic until it's either caught or it reaches the main thread.~~
    
    `async_task::Task`  bubbles up panics already, this will transitively push panics all the way to the main thread.
    
    #### Abort on Panic
    The nuclear option. Log the error, abort the entire process on any thread in the task pool panicking. Definitely avoids any additional infrastructure for passing the panic around, and might actually lead to more efficient code as any unwinding is optimized out. However gives the developer zero options for dealing with the issue, a seemingly poor choice for debuggability, and prevents graceful shutdown of the process. Potentially an option for handling very low-level task management (a la #4740). Roughly takes the shape of:
    
    ```rust
    struct AbortOnPanic;
    
    impl Drop for AbortOnPanic {
       fn drop(&mut self) {
         abort!();
       }
    }
    
    let guard = AbortOnPanic;
    // Run task
    std::mem::forget(AbortOnPanic);
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Changed: `bevy_tasks::TaskPool`'s threads  will no longer terminate permanently when a task scheduled onto them panics.
    Changed: `bevy_tasks::Task` and`bevy_tasks::Scope` will propagate panics in the spawned tasks/scopes to the parent thread.

    Add z-index support with a predictable UI stack (#5877)
    
    # Objective
    
    Add consistent UI rendering and interaction where deep nodes inside two different hierarchies will never render on top of one-another by default and offer an escape hatch (z-index) for nodes to change their depth.
    
    ## The problem with current implementation
    
    The current implementation of UI rendering is broken in that regard, mainly because [it sets the Z value of the `Transform` component based on a "global Z" space](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_ui/src/update.rs#L43) shared by all nodes in the UI. This doesn't account for the fact that each node's final `GlobalTransform` value will be relative to its parent. This effectively makes the depth unpredictable when two deep trees are rendered on top of one-another.
    
    At the moment, it's also up to each part of the UI code to sort all of the UI nodes. The solution that's offered here does the full sorting of UI node entities once and offers the result through a resource so that all systems can use it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    ### New ZIndex component
    This adds a new optional `ZIndex` enum component for nodes which offers two mechanism:
    - `ZIndex::Local(i32)`: Overrides the depth of the node relative to its siblings.
    - `ZIndex::Global(i32)`: Overrides the depth of the node relative to the UI root. This basically allows any node in the tree to "escape" the parent and be ordered relative to the entire UI.
    
    Note that in the current implementation, omitting `ZIndex` on a node has the same result as adding `ZIndex::Local(0)`. Additionally, the "global" stacking context is essentially a way to add your node to the root stacking context, so using `ZIndex::Local(n)` on a root node (one without parent) will share that space with all nodes using `Index::Global(n)`.
    
    ### New UiStack resource
    This adds a new `UiStack` resource which is calculated from both hierarchy and `ZIndex` during UI update and contains a vector of all node entities in the UI, ordered by depth (from farthest from camera to closest). This is exposed publicly by the bevy_ui crate with the hope that it can be used for consistent ordering and to reduce the amount of sorting that needs to be done by UI systems (i.e. instead of sorting everything by `global_transform.z` in every system, this array can be iterated over).
    
    ### New z_index example
    This also adds a new z_index example that showcases the new `ZIndex` component. It's also a good general demo of the new UI stack system, because making this kind of UI was very broken with the old system (e.g. nodes would render on top of each other, not respecting hierarchy or insert order at all).

    - Changed bevy_ui rendering to use UiStack instead of z ordering.
    - Changed bevy_ui focus/interaction system to use UiStack instead of z ordering.
    - Added a new z_index example.

    bevy_dynamic_plugin: make it possible to handle loading errors (#6437)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, `bevy_dynamic_plugin` simply panics on error. This makes it impossible to handle failures in applications that use this feature.
    
    For example, I'd like to build an optional expansion for my game, that may not be distributed to all users. I want to use `bevy_dynamic_plugin` for loading it. I want my game to try to load it on startup, but continue without it if it cannot be loaded.
    
    ## Solution
    
     - Make the `dynamically_load_plugin` function return a `Result`, so it can gracefully return loading errors.
     - Create an error enum type, to provide useful information about the kind of error. This adds `thiserror` to the dependencies of `bevy_dynamic_plugin`, but that dependency is already used in other parts of bevy (such as `bevy_asset`), so not a big deal.
    
     I chose not to change the behavior of the builder method in the App extension trait. I kept it as panicking. There is no clean way (that I'm aware of) to make a builder-style API that has fallible methods. So it is either a panic or a warning. I feel the panic is more appropriate.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
     - `bevy_dynamic_plugin::dynamically_load_plugin` now returns `Result` instead of panicking, to allow for error handling

    Rework ViewTarget to better support post processing (#6415)
    
    # Objective
    
    Post processing effects cannot read and write to the same texture. Currently they must own their own intermediate texture and redundantly copy from that back to the main texture. This is very inefficient.
    
    Additionally, working with ViewTarget is more complicated than it needs to be, especially when working with HDR textures.
    
    ## Solution
    
    `ViewTarget` now stores two copies of the "main texture". It uses an atomic value to track which is currently the "main texture" (this interior mutability is necessary to accommodate read-only RenderGraph execution).
    
    `ViewTarget` now has a `post_process_write` method, which will return a source and destination texture. Each call to this method will flip between the two copies of the "main texture".
    
    ```rust
    let post_process = render_target.post_process_write();
    let source_texture = post_process.source;
    let destination_texture = post_process.destination;
    ```
    The caller _must_ read from the source texture and write to the destination texture, as it is assumed that the destination texture will become the new "main texture".
    
    
    For simplicity / understandability `ViewTarget` is now a flat type. "hdr-ness" is a property of the `TextureFormat`. The internals are fully private in the interest of providing simple / consistent apis. Developers can now easily access the main texture by calling `view_target.main_texture()`.
    
    HDR ViewTargets no longer have an "ldr texture" with `TextureFormat::bevy_default`. They _only_ have their two "hdr" textures. This simplifies the mental model.  All we have is the "currently active hdr texture" and the "other hdr texture", which we flip between for post processing effects.
    
    The tonemapping node has been rephrased to use this "post processing pattern". The blit pass has been removed, and it now only runs a pass when HDR is enabled. Notably, both the input and output texture are assumed to be HDR. This means that tonemapping behaves just like any other "post processing effect". It could theoretically be moved anywhere in the "effect chain" and continue to work.
    
    In general, I think these changes will make the lives of people making post processing effects much easier. And they better position us to start building higher level / more structured  "post processing effect stacks".
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `ViewTarget` now stores two copies of the "main texture". Calling `ViewTarget::post_process_write` will flip between copies of the main texture.

    - Remove the second windowed Bevy App [since winit does not support this](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/v0.27.4/src/event_loop.rs#L82-L83)
    - Add title to the Bevy window asking the user to close it
    
    This is more of a quick fix to have a working example. It would be nicer if we had a small real usecase for this functionality.
    Another alternativ that I tried out: If we want to showcase a second Bevy app as it was before, we could still do this as long as one of them does not have a window. But I don't see how this is helpful in the context of the example, so I stuck with only one Bevy app and a simple print afterwards.

    bevy_scene: Serialize entities to map (#6416)
    
    # Objective
    
    Entities are unique, however, this is not reflected in the scene format. Currently, entities are stored in a list where a user could inadvertently create a duplicate of the same entity.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Switch from the list representation to a map representation for entities.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * The `entities` field in the scene format is now a map of entity ID to entity data
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The scene format now stores its collection of entities in a map rather than a list:
    
    ```rust
    // OLD
    (
      entities: [
        (
          entity: 12,
          components: {
            "bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform": (
              translation: (

    Unique plugin (#6411)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make it impossible to add a plugin twice
    - This is going to be more a risk for plugins with configurations, to avoid things like `App::new().add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).add_plugin(ImagePlugin::default_nearest())`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Panic when a plugin is added twice
    - It's still possible to mark a plugin as not unique by overriding `is_unique`
    - ~~Simpler version of~~ #3988 (not simpler anymore because of how `PluginGroupBuilder` implements `PluginGroup`)

    - On Safari mobile, calling winit_window.set_cursor_grab(true) fails as the API is not implemented (as there is no cursor on Safari mobile, the api doesn't make sense there). I don't know about other mobile browsers
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Do not call the api to release cursor grab on window creation, as the cursor is not grabbed anyway at this point
    - This is #3617 which was lost in #6218

    Add a way to toggle `AudioSink` (#6321)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently toggling an `AudioSink` (for example from a game menu) requires writing

    It would be nicer if we could reduce this down to a single line
    
    ```rs
    sink.toggle();
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add an `AudioSink::toggle` method which does exactly that.

    - Fixed comment style
    
    # Objective
    
    With Rust 1.56 it's possible to shrink vectors to a specified capacity. Visibility system had a comment before asking for that feature to free unused memory by a vector if its capacity is two times larger than the length.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Shrinking the vector of visible entities to the nearest power of 2 elements next to `len()`, if capacity exceeds it more than two times.

    Fix query.to_readonly().get_component_mut() soundness bug (#6401)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fix the soundness issue outlined in #5866. In short the problem is that `query.to_readonly().get_component_mut::<T>()` can provide unsound mutable access to the component. This PR is an alternative to just removing the offending api. Given that `to_readonly` is a useful tool, I think this approach is a preferable short term solution. Long term I think theres a better solution out there, but we can find that on its own time.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add what amounts to a "dirty flag" that marks Queries that have been converted to their read-only variant via `to_readonly` as dirty. When this flag is set to true, `get_component_mut` will fail with an error, preventing the unsound access.

    Rename Handle::as_weak() to cast_weak() (#5321)
    
    # Objective
    
    Following discussion on #3536 and #3522, `Handle::as_weak()` takes a type `U`, reinterpreting the handle as of another asset type while keeping the same ID. This is mainly used today in font atlas code. This PR does two things:
    
    - Rename the method to `cast_weak()` to make its intent more clear
    - Actually change the type uuid in the handle if it's not an asset path variant.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Rename `Handle::as_weak` uses to `Handle::cast_weak`
    
        The method now properly sets the associated type uuid if the handle is a direct reference (e.g. not a reference to an `AssetPath`), so adjust you code accordingly if you relied on the previous behavior.

    Use default serde impls for Entity (#6194)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently for entities we serialize only `id`. But this is not very expected behavior. For example, in networking, when the server sends its state, it contains entities and components. On the client, I create new objects and map them (using `EntityMap`) to those received from the server (to know which one matches which). And if `generation` field is missing, this mapping can be broken. Example:
    
    1. Server sends an entity `Entity{ id: 2, generation: 1}` with components.
    2. Client puts the received entity in a map and create a new entity that maps to this received entity. The new entity have different `id` and `generation`. Let's call it `Entity{ id: 12, generation: 4}`.
    3. Client sends a command for `Entity{ id: 12, generation: 4}`. To do so, it maps local entity to the one from server. But `generation` field is 0 because it was omitted for serialization on the server. So it maps to `Entity{ id: 2, generation: 0}`.
    4. Server receives `Entity{ id: 2, generation: 0}` which is invalid.
    
    In my game I worked around it by [writing custom serialization](https://github.com/dollisgame/dollis/blob/master/src/core/network/entity_serde.rs) and using `serde(with = "...")`. But it feels like a bad default to me.
    
    Using `Entity` over a custom `NetworkId` also have the following advantages:
    
    1. Re-use `MapEntities` trait to map `Entity`s in replicated components.
    2. Instead of server `Entity <-> NetworkId ` and `Entity <-> NetworkId`, we map entities only on client.
    3. No need to handling uniqueness. It's a rare case, but makes things simpler. For example, I don't need to query for a resource to create an unique ID.
    
    Closes #6143.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use default serde impls. If anyone want to avoid wasting memory on `generation`, they can create a new type that holds `u32`. This is what Bevy do for [DynamicEntity](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/scene/struct.DynamicEntity.html) to serialize scenes. And I don't see any use case to serialize an entity id expect this one.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - Entity now serializes / deserializes `generation` field.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Entity now fully serialized. If you want to serialze only `id`, as it was before, you can create a new type that wraps `u32`.

    ^ enable this
    
    Concretely, I need to
    - list all handle ids for an asset type
    - fetch the asset as `dyn Reflect`, given a `HandleUntyped`
    - when encountering a `Handle<T>`, find out what asset type that handle refers to (`T`'s type id) and turn the handle into a `HandleUntyped`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - add `ReflectAsset` type containing function pointers for working with assets
    ```rust
    pub struct ReflectAsset {
        type_uuid: Uuid,
        assets_resource_type_id: TypeId, // TypeId of the `Assets<T>` resource
    
        get: fn(&World, HandleUntyped) -> Option<&dyn Reflect>,
        get_mut: fn(&mut World, HandleUntyped) -> Option<&mut dyn Reflect>,
        get_unchecked_mut: unsafe fn(&World, HandleUntyped) -> Option<&mut dyn Reflect>,
        add: fn(&mut World, &dyn Reflect) -> HandleUntyped,
        set: fn(&mut World, HandleUntyped, &dyn Reflect) -> HandleUntyped,
        len: fn(&World) -> usize,
        ids: for<'w> fn(&'w World) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item = HandleId> + 'w>,
        remove: fn(&mut World, HandleUntyped) -> Option<Box<dyn Reflect>>,
    }
    ```
    - add `ReflectHandle` type relating the handle back to the asset type and providing a way to create a `HandleUntyped`
    ```rust
    pub struct ReflectHandle {
        type_uuid: Uuid,
        asset_type_id: TypeId,
        downcast_handle_untyped: fn(&dyn Any) -> Option<HandleUntyped>,
    }
    ```
    - add the corresponding `FromType` impls
    - add a function `app.register_asset_reflect` which is supposed to be called after `.add_asset` and registers `ReflectAsset` and `ReflectHandle` in the type registry
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - add `ReflectAsset` and `ReflectHandle` types, which allow code to use reflection to manipulate arbitrary assets without knowing their types at compile time

    Clean up Fetch code (#4800)
    
    # Objective
    Clean up code surrounding fetch by pulling out the common parts into the iteration code.
    
    ## Solution
    Merge `Fetch::table_fetch` and `Fetch::archetype_fetch` into a single API: `Fetch::fetch(&mut self, entity: &Entity, table_row: &usize)`. This provides everything any fetch requires to internally decide which storage to read from and get the underlying data. All of these functions are marked as `#[inline(always)]` and the arguments are passed as references to attempt to optimize out the argument that isn't being used.
    
    External to `Fetch`, Query iteration has been changed to keep track of the table row and entity outside of fetch, which moves a lot of the expensive bookkeeping `Fetch` structs had previously done internally into the outer loop.
    
    ~~TODO: Benchmark, docs~~ Done.

    bevy_scene: Stabilize entity order in `DynamicSceneBuilder` (#6382)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, `DynamicSceneBuilder` keeps track of entities via a `HashMap`. This has an unintended side-effect in that, when building the full `DynamicScene`, we aren't guaranteed any particular order.
    
    In other words, inserting Entity A then Entity B can result in either `[A, B]` or `[B, A]`. This can be rather annoying when running tests on scenes generated via the builder as it will work sometimes but not other times. There's also the potential that this might unnecessarily clutter up VCS diffs for scene files (assuming they had an intentional order).
    
    ## Solution
    
    Store `DynamicSceneBuilder`'s entities in a `Vec` rather than a `HashMap`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Stablized entity order in `DynamicSceneBuilder` (0.9.0-dev)

    Resolve most remaining execution-order ambiguities (#6341)
    
    # Objective
    
    Bevy's internal plugins have lots of execution-order ambiguities, which makes the ambiguity detection tool very noisy for our users.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Silence every last ambiguity that can currently be resolved.
    Each time an ambiguity is silenced, it is accompanied by a comment describing why it is correct. This description should be based on the public API of the respective systems. Thus, I have added documentation to some systems describing how they use some resources.
    
    # Future work
    
    Some ambiguities remain, due to issues out of scope for this PR.
    
    * The ambiguity checker does not respect `Without<>` filters, leading to false positives.
    * Ambiguities between `bevy_ui` and `bevy_animation` cannot be resolved, since neither crate knows that the other exists. We will need a general solution to this problem.

    Expose rodio's Source and Sample traits in bevy_audio (#6374)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #5876 .
    
    ## Solution
    
    - added pub use statements to re-export the following traits in bevy_audio: rodio::source::Source, rodio::Sample, rodio::cpal::Sample.
    - rodio::cpal::Sample was re-exported as CpalSample to avoid naming conflict with rodio::Sample.

    bevy_scene: Use map for scene `components` (#6345)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently scenes define components using a list:
    
    ```rust
    [
      (
        entity: 0,
        components: [
          {
            "bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform": (
              translation: (
                x: 0.0,
                y: 0.0,
                z: 0.0
              ),
              rotation: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
              scale: (
                x: 1.0,
                y: 1.0,
                z: 1.0
              ),
            ),
          },
          {
            "my_crate::Foo": (
              text: "Hello World",
            ),
          },
          {
            "my_crate::Bar": (
              baz: 123,
            ),
          },
        ],
      ),
    ]
    ```
    
    However, this representation has some drawbacks (as pointed out by @Metadorius in [this](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4561#issuecomment-1202215565) comment):
    
    1. Increased nesting and more characters (minor effect on overall size)
    2. More importantly, by definition, entities cannot have more than one instance of any given component. Therefore, such data is best stored as a map— where all values are meant to have unique keys.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    Change `components` to store a map of components rather than a list:
    
    ```rust
    [
      (
        entity: 0,
        components: {
          "bevy_transform::components::transform::Transform": (
            translation: (
              x: 0.0,
              y: 0.0,
              z: 0.0
            ),
            rotation: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
            scale: (
              x: 1.0,
              y: 1.0,
              z: 1.0
            ),
          ),
          "my_crate::Foo": (
            text: "Hello World",
          ),
          "my_crate::Bar": (
            baz: 123
          ),
        },
      ),
    ]
    ```
    
    #### Code Representation
    
    This change only affects the scene format itself. `DynamicEntity` still stores its components as a list. The reason for this is that storing such data as a map is not really needed since:
    1. The "key" of each value is easily found by just calling `Reflect::type_name` on it
    2. We should be generating such structs using the `World` itself which upholds the one-component-per-entity rule
    
    One could in theory create manually create a `DynamicEntity` with duplicate components, but this isn't something I think we should focus on in this PR. `DynamicEntity` can be broken in other ways (i.e. storing a non-component in the components list), and resolving its issues can be done in a separate PR.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * The scene format now uses a map to represent the collection of components rather than a list
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The scene format now uses a map to represent the collection of components. Scene files will need to update from the old list format.

    Support arbitrary RenderTarget texture formats (#6380)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, Bevy only supports rendering to the current "surface texture format". This means that "render to texture" scenarios must use the exact format the primary window's surface uses, or Bevy will crash. This is even harder than it used to be now that we detect preferred surface formats at runtime instead of using hard coded BevyDefault values.
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. Look up and store each window surface's texture format alongside other extracted window information
    2. Specialize the upscaling pass on the current `RenderTarget`'s texture format, now that we can cheaply correlate render targets to their current texture format
    3. Remove the old `SurfaceTextureFormat` and `AvailableTextureFormats`: these are now redundant with the information stored on each extracted window, and probably should not have been globals in the first place (as in theory each surface could have a different format).
    
    This means you can now use any texture format you want when rendering to a texture! For example, changing the `render_to_texture` example to use `R16Float` now doesn't crash / properly only stores the red component:

    separate tonemapping and upscaling passes (#3425)
    
    Attempt to make features like bloom https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2876 easier to implement.
    
    **This PR:**
    - Moves the tonemapping from `pbr.wgsl` into a separate pass
    - also add a separate upscaling pass after the tonemapping which writes to the swap chain (enables resolution-independant rendering and post-processing after tonemapping)
    - adds a `hdr` bool to the camera which controls whether the pbr and sprite shaders render into a `Rgba16Float` texture
    
    **Open questions:**
    - ~should the 2d graph work the same as the 3d one?~ it is the same now
    - ~The current solution is a bit inflexible because while you can add a post processing pass that writes to e.g. the `hdr_texture`, you can't write to a separate `user_postprocess_texture` while reading the `hdr_texture` and tell the tone mapping pass to read from the `user_postprocess_texture` instead. If the tonemapping and upscaling render graph nodes were to take in a `TextureView` instead of the view entity this would almost work, but the bind groups for their respective input textures are already created in the `Queue` render stage in the hardcoded order.~ solved by creating bind groups in render node
    
    **New render graph:**

    Derive `Reflect` + `FromReflect` for input types (#6232)
    
    # Objective
    
    Adds support for reflecting many more of the input types. This allows those types to be used via scripting, `bevy-inspector-egui`, etc. These types are registered by the `InputPlugin` so that they're automatically available to anyone who wants to use them
    
    Closes #6223
    
    ## Solution
    
    Many types now have `#[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]` added to them in `bevy_input`. Additionally, `#[reflect(traits...)]` has been added for applicable traits to the types.
    
    This PR does not add reflection support for types which have private fields. Notably, `Touch` and `Touches` don't implement `Reflect`/`FromReflect`.
    
    This adds the "glam" feature to the `bevy_reflect` dependency for package `bevy_input`. Since `bevy_input` transitively depends on `glam` already, all this brings in are the reflection `impl`s.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - `Input<T>` now implements `Reflect` via `#[reflect]` instead of `#[reflect_value]`. This means it now exposes its private fields via the `Reflect` trait rather than being treated as a value type. For code that relies on the `Input<T>` struct being treated as a value type by reflection, it is still possible to wrap the `Input<T>` type with a wrapper struct and apply `#[reflect_value]` to it.
      - As a reminder, private fields exposed via reflection are not subject to any stability guarantees.
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Added
    - Implemented `Reflect` + `FromReflect` for many input-related types. These types are automatically registered when adding the `InputPlugin`.

    Avoid making `Fetch`s `Clone` (#5593)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Do not implement `Copy` or `Clone` for `Fetch` types as this is kind of sus soundness wise (it feels like cloning an `IterMut` in safe code to me). Cloning a fetch seems important to think about soundness wise when doing it so I prefer this over adding a `Clone` bound to the assoc type definition (i.e. `type Fetch: Clone`) even though that would also solve the other listed things here.
    - Remove a bunch of `QueryFetch<'w, Q>: Clone` bounds from our API as now all fetches can be "cloned" for use in `iter_combinations`. This should also help avoid the type inference regression ptrification introduced where `for<'a> QueryFetch<'a, Q>: Trait` bounds misbehave since we no longer need any of those kind of higher ranked bounds (although in practice we had none anyway).
    - Stop being able to "forget" to implement clone for fetches, we've had a lot of issues where either `derive(Clone)` was used instead of a manual impl (so we ended up with too tight bounds on the impl) or flat out forgot to implement Clone at all. With this change all fetches are able to be cloned for `iter_combinations` so this will no longer be possible to mess up.
    
    On an unrelated note, while making this PR I realised we probably want safety invariants on `archetype/table_fetch` that nothing aliases the table_row/archetype_index according to the access we set.

    ## Changelog
    
    `Clone` and `Copy` were removed from all `Fetch` types.

    }))
    ```
    
    
    The `ImageSettings` settings have been moved from a resource to `ImagePlugin` configuration:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (Bevy 0.8)
    app
      .insert_resource(ImageSettings::default_nearest())
      .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    
    // New (Bevy 0.9)

    ```
    
    
    The `DefaultTaskPoolOptions` settings have been moved from a resource to `CorePlugin::task_pool_options`:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (Bevy 0.8)
    app
      .insert_resource(DefaultTaskPoolOptions::with_num_threads(4))
      .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)

    }))

    fix: specify required trybuild patch version (#6333)
    
    # Objective
    
    This is a follow-up to #6317, which makes use of a feature of the newest `trybuild` version, `1.0.71`, but does not specify the new patch version in `bevy_ecs_compile_fail_tests/Cargo.toml`.
    
    The PR passed CI because CI downloaded the latest `trybuild` version satisfying the dependency specification. However, Cargo will not know an update is required if a user already has a `^1.0` version of `trybuild` cached locally, which causes the new `$N` syntax to fail the tests.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Updated the `trybuild` requirement to `1.0.71`.

    > This section is optional. If this was a trivial fix, or has no externally-visible impact, you can delete this section.
    
    - What changed as a result of this PR? Fixed dependency conflict for building projects.
    Current build of StarRust runs successfully with the `thiserror` reversion: https://github.com/LarsDu/StarRust
    But will run into dependency conflicts if `thiserror` is version 1.037

    Add More Description to the Iter Combinations Documentation (#6260)
    
    # Objective
    
    I was trying to implement a collision system for my game, and believed that the iter_combinations method might be what I need. But I couldn't find a simple explanation of what a combination was in Bevy and thought it could use some more explanation.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I added some description to the documentation that can hopefully further elaborate on what a combination is.
    
    I also changed up the docs for the method because a combination is a different thing than a permutation but the Bevy docs seemed to use them interchangeably.

    Remove ExactSizeIterator from QueryCombinationIter (#5895)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `QueryCombinationIter` can have sizes greater than `usize::MAX`.
    - Fixes #5846
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Only the implementation of `ExactSizeIterator` has been removed. Instead of using `query_combination.len()`, you can use `query_combination.size_hint().0` to get the same value as before.
    
    ---
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Switch to using other methods of getting the length.

    Plugins own their settings. Rework PluginGroup trait. (#6336)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5884 #2879
    Alternative to #2988 #5885 #2886
    
    "Immutable" Plugin settings are currently represented as normal ECS resources, which are read as part of plugin init. This presents a number of problems:
    
    1. If a user inserts the plugin settings resource after the plugin is initialized, it will be silently ignored (and use the defaults instead)
    2. Users can modify the plugin settings resource after the plugin has been initialized. This creates a false sense of control over settings that can no longer be changed.
    
    (1) and (2) are especially problematic and confusing for the `WindowDescriptor` resource, but this is a general problem.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Immutable Plugin settings now live on each Plugin struct (ex: `WindowPlugin`). PluginGroups have been reworked to support overriding plugin values. This also removes the need for the `add_plugins_with` api, as the `add_plugins` api can use the builder pattern directly. Settings that can be used at runtime continue to be represented as ECS resources.
    
    Plugins are now configured like this:
    
    ```rust
    app.add_plugin(AssetPlugin {
      watch_for_changes: true,
      ..default()
    })
    ```
    
    PluginGroups are now configured like this:
    
    ```rust
    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins
      .set(AssetPlugin {
        watch_for_changes: true,
        ..default()
      })
    )
    ```
    
    This is an alternative to #2988, which is similar. But I personally prefer this solution for a couple of reasons:
    * ~~#2988 doesn't solve (1)~~ #2988 does solve (1) and will panic in that case. I was wrong!
    * This PR directly ties plugin settings to Plugin types in a 1:1 relationship, rather than a loose "setup resource" <-> plugin coupling (where the setup resource is consumed by the first plugin that uses it).
    * I'm not a huge fan of overloading the ECS resource concept and implementation for something that has very different use cases and constraints.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - PluginGroups can now be configured directly using the builder pattern. Individual plugin values can be overridden by using `plugin_group.set(SomePlugin {})`, which enables overriding default plugin values.
    - `WindowDescriptor` plugin settings have been moved to `WindowPlugin` and `AssetServerSettings` have been moved to `AssetPlugin`
    - `app.add_plugins_with` has been replaced by using `add_plugins` with the builder pattern.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The `WindowDescriptor` settings have been moved from a resource to `WindowPlugin::window`:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (Bevy 0.8)
    app
      .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {
        width: 400.0,
        ..default()
      })
      .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    
    // New (Bevy 0.9)
    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(WindowPlugin {
      window: WindowDescriptor {
        width: 400.0,
        ..default()
      },
      ..default()
    }))
    ```
    
    
    The `AssetServerSettings` resource has been removed in favor of direct `AssetPlugin` configuration:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (Bevy 0.8)
    app
      .insert_resource(AssetServerSettings {
        watch_for_changes: true,
        ..default()
      })
      .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
    
    // New (Bevy 0.9)
    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(AssetPlugin {
      watch_for_changes: true,
      ..default()
    }))
    ```
    
    `add_plugins_with` has been replaced by `add_plugins` in combination with the builder pattern:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (Bevy 0.8)
    app.add_plugins_with(DefaultPlugins, |group| group.disable::<AssetPlugin>());
    
    // New (Bevy 0.9)
    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.build().disable::<AssetPlugin>());
    ```

    bevy_scene: Replace root list with struct (#6354)
    
    # Objective
    
    Scenes are currently represented as a list of entities. This is all we need currently, but we may want to add more data to this format in the future (metadata, asset lists, etc.).
    
    It would be nice to update the format in preparation of possible future changes. Doing so now (i.e., before 0.9) could mean reduced[^1] breakage for things added in 0.10.
    
    [^1]: Obviously, adding features runs the risk of breaking things regardless. But if all features added are for whatever reason optional or well-contained, then users should at least have an easier time updating.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Made the scene root a struct rather than a list.
    
    ```rust
    (
      entities: [
        // Entity data here...
      ]
    )
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * The scene format now puts the entity list in a newly added `entities` field, rather than having it be the root object
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The scene file format now uses a struct as the root object rather than a list of entities. The list of entities is now found in the `entities` field of this struct.
    
    ```rust
    // OLD
    [
      (
        entity: 0,
        components: [
          // Components...
        ]
      ),
    ]
    
    // NEW
    (
      entities: [
        (
          entity: 0,
          components: [
            // Components...
          ]
        ),
      ]
    )
    ```

    # Objective
    
    - You usually want to say that a given animation *should* be playing, doing nothing if it's already playing.

    ## Migration guide
    
    - If you were using `play` to restart an animation that was already playing, that functionality has been moved to `start`. Now, `play` won't have any effect if the requested animation is already playing.

    # Objective
    
    - Improve #3953
    
    ## Solution
    
    - The very specific circumstances under which the render world is reset meant that the flush_as_invalid function could be replaced with one that had a noop as its init method.
    - This removes a double-writing issue leading to greatly increased performance.
    
    Running the reproduction code in the linked issue, this change nearly doubles the framerate.

    bevy_reflect: Fix `DynamicScene` not respecting component registrations during serialization (#6288)
    
    # Objective
    
    When running the scene example, you might notice we end up printing out the following:
    ```ron
    // ...
    {
      "scene::ComponentB": (
        value: "hello",
        _time_since_startup: (
          secs: 0,
          nanos: 0,
        ),
      ),
    },
    // ...
    ```
    
    We should not be printing out `_time_since_startup` as the field is marked with `#[reflect(skip_serializing)]`:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component, Reflect)]
    #[reflect(Component)]
    struct ComponentB {
      pub value: String,
      #[reflect(skip_serializing)]
      pub _time_since_startup: Duration,
    }
    ```
    
    This is because when we create the `DynamicScene`, we end up calling `Reflect::clone_value`:
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/82126697ee4f635cf6b22e0b9f25e5aca95fda4a/crates/bevy_scene/src/dynamic_scene_builder.rs#L114-L114
    
    This results in non-Value types being cloned into Dynamic types, which means the `TypeId` returned from `reflected_value.type_id()` is not the same as the original component's.
    
    And this meant we were not able to locate the correct `TypeRegistration`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use `TypeInfo::type_id()` instead of calling `Any::type_id()` on the value directly.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Fix a bug introduced in `0.9.0-dev` where scenes disregarded component's type registrations

    feat: add GamepadInfo, expose gamepad names (#6342)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6339.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR adds a new type, `GamepadInfo`, which holds metadata associated with a particular `Gamepad`. The `Gamepads` resource now holds a `HashMap<Gamepad, GamepadInfo>`. The `GamepadInfo` is created when the gamepad backend (by default `bevy_gilrs`) emits a "gamepad connected" event.
    
    The `gamepad_viewer` example has been updated to showcase the new functionality.
    
    Before:
    
    ![bevy-gamepad-old](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86984145/197359427-2130a3c0-bd8a-4683-ae24-2a9eaa98b586.png)

    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    - Added `GamepadInfo`.
    - Added `Gamepads::name()`, which returns the name of the specified gamepad if it exists.
    
    ### Changed
    
    - `GamepadEventType::Connected` is now a tuple variant with a single field of type `GamepadInfo`.
    - Since `GamepadInfo` is not `Copy`, `GamepadEventType` is no longer `Copy`. The same is true of `GamepadEvent` and `GamepadEventRaw`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Pattern matches on `GamepadEventType::Connected` will need to be updated, as the form of the variant has changed.
    - Code that requires `GamepadEvent`, `GamepadEventRaw` or `GamepadEventType` to be `Copy` will need to be updated.

    Add `set_parent` and `remove_parent` to `EntityCommands` (#6189)
    
    I found myself doing
    ```rust
    let child = commands.spawn(..).id();
    commands.entity(parent).add_child(child);
    ```
    When that could just be
    ```rust
    commands.spawn(..).set_parent(parent);
    ```
    
    Adding `set_parent` was trivial as it's just an `AddChild` command. Most of the changes are for `remove_parent`.
    Also updated some outdated docs.

    # Objective
    
    - Addresses #6146 by allowing manual `Time` updating
    
    ## Solution
    - Create `TimeUpdateStrategy` config resource
    - Allow users to specify a manual `Instant/Duration` or leave as default (automatic)
    - Get resource in `bevy_time::time_system`and update time with desired value
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Add `TimeUpdateStrategy` resource
    - Update `bevy_time::time_system` to use optional manual values

    Utility methods for Val (#6134)
    
    # Objective
    
    Adds a better interface for performing mathematical operations with UI unit `Val`. Fixes #6080.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added `try_add` and `try_sub` methods to Val.
    - Removed the `Add` and `AddAssign` impls for `Val` that introduced unintuitive and bug-prone behaviour.
    - As a consequence of the prior,  ~~changed the `Add` and `Sub` impls for the `Size` struct to take a `(Val, Val)` instead of `Vec2`~~ deleted the `Add` and `Sub` impls for the `Size` struct
    - Added a `From<(Val, Val)>` impl for the `Size` struct
    - Added `evaluate(size: f32)` method that converts from `Val::Percent` to `Val::Px`.
    - Added `try_add_with_size` and `try_sub_with_size` methods to `Val`, which evaluate `Val::Percent` values into `Val::Px` values before adding.
    
    ---
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Instead of using the + and - operators, perform calculations on `Val`s using the new `try_add` and `try_sub` methods. Multiplication and division remained unchanged. Also, when adding or subtracting from `Size`, ~~use a `Val` tuple instead of `Vec2`~~ perform the addition on `width` and `height` separately.

    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5559
    
    Replaces #5628
    
    ## Solution
    
    Because the generated method from_components() creates an instance of Self my implementation requires any field type that is marked to be ignored to implement Default.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Added the possibility to ignore fields in a bundle with `#[bundle(ignore)]`. Typically used when `PhantomData` needs to be added to a `Bundle`.

    # Objective
    
    - #4466 broke local tasks running.
    - Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6120
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add system for ticking local executors on main thread into bevy_core where the tasks pools are initialized.
    - Add ticking local executors into thread executors
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - tick all thread local executors in task pool.
    
    ## Notes
    
    - ~~Not 100% sure about this PR. Ticking the local executor for the main thread in scope feels a little kludgy as it requires users of bevy_tasks to be calling scope periodically for those tasks to make progress.~~ took this out in favor of a system that ticks the local executors.

    Add Exponential Moving Average into diagnostics (#4992)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add Time-Adjusted Rolling EMA-based smoothing to diagnostics.
    - Closes #4983; see that issue for more more information.
    
    ## Terms
    
    - EMA - [Exponential Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average)
    - SMA - [Simple Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average)
    
    ## Solution
    
    - We use a fairly standard approximation of a true EMA where $EMA_{\text{frame}} = EMA_{\text{previous}} + \alpha \left( x_{\text{frame}} - EMA_{\text{previous}} \right)$ where $\alpha = \Delta t / \tau$ and $\tau$ is an arbitrary smoothness factor. (See #4983 for more discussion of the math.)
    - The smoothness factor is here defaulted to $2 / 21$; this was chosen fairly arbitrarily as supposedly related to the existing 20-bucket SMA.
    - The smoothness factor can be set on a per-diagnostic basis via `Diagnostic::with_smoothing_factor`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    - `Diagnostic::smoothed` - provides an exponentially smoothed view of a recorded diagnostic, to e.g. reduce jitter in frametime readings.
    
    ### Changed
    - `LogDiagnosticsPlugin` now records the smoothed value rather than the raw value.
      - For diagnostics recorded less often than every 0.1 seconds, this change to defaults will have no visible effect.
      - For discrete diagnostics where this smoothing is not desirable, set a smoothing factor of 0 to disable smoothing.
      - The average of the recent history is still shown when available.

    Extract Resources into their own dedicated storage (#4809)
    
    # Objective
    At least partially addresses #6282.
    
    Resources are currently stored as a dedicated Resource archetype (ID 1). This allows for easy code reusability, but unnecessarily adds 72 bytes (on 64-bit systems) to the struct that is only used for that one archetype. It also requires several fields to be `pub(crate)` which isn't ideal.
    
    This should also remove one sparse-set lookup from fetching, inserting, and removing resources from a `World`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `Resources` parallel to `Tables` and `SparseSets` and extract the functionality used by `Archetype` in it.
    - Remove `unique_components` from `Archetype`
    - Remove the `pub(crate)` on `Archetype::components`.
    - Remove `ArchetypeId::RESOURCE`
    - Remove `Archetypes::resource` and `Archetypes::resource_mut`
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Added: `Resources` type to store resources.
    Added: `Storages::resource`
    Removed: `ArchetypeId::RESOURCE`
    Removed: `Archetypes::resource` and `Archetypes::resources`
    Removed: `Archetype::unique_components` and `Archetypes::unique_components_mut`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Resources have been moved to `Resources` under `Storages` in `World`. All code dependent on `Archetype::unique_components(_mut)` should access it via `world.storages().resources()` instead.
    
    All APIs accessing the raw data of individual resources (mutable *and* read-only) have been removed as these APIs allowed for unsound unsafe code. All usages of these APIs should be changed to use `World::{get, insert, remove}_resource`.

    Skip empty archetypes and tables when iterating over queries (#4724)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up queries that are fragmented over many empty archetypes and tables.
    
    ## Solution
    Add a early-out to check if the table or archetype is empty before iterating over it. This adds an extra branch for every archetype matched, but skips setting the archetype/table to the underlying state and any iteration over it.
    
    This may not be worth it for the default `Query::iter` and maybe even the `Query::for_each` implementations, but this definitely avoids scheduling unnecessary tasks in the `Query::par_for_each` case.
    
    Ideally, `matched_archetypes` should only contain archetypes where there's actually work to do, but this would add a `O(n)` flat cost to every call to `update_archetypes` that scales with the number of matched archetypes.

    Add global time scaling (#5752)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make `Time` API more consistent.
    - Support time accel/decel/pause.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This is just the `Time` half of #3002. I was told that part isn't controversial.
    
    - Give the "delta time" and "total elapsed time" methods `f32`, `f64`, and `Duration` variants with consistent naming.
    - Implement accelerating / decelerating the passage of time.
    - Implement stopping time.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Changed `time_since_startup` to `elapsed` because `time.time_*` is just silly.
    - Added `relative_speed` and `set_relative_speed` methods.
    - Added `is_paused`, `pause`, `unpause` , and methods. (I'd prefer `resume`, but `unpause` matches `Timer` API.)
    - Added `raw_*` variants of the "delta time" and "total elapsed time" methods.
    - Added `first_update` method because there's a non-zero duration between startup and the first update.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - `time.time_since_startup()` -> `time.elapsed()`
    - `time.seconds_since_startup()` -> `time.elapsed_seconds_f64()`
    - `time.seconds_since_startup_wrapped_f32()` -> `time.elapsed_seconds_wrapped()`
    
    If you aren't sure which to use, most systems should continue to use "scaled" time (e.g. `time.delta_seconds()`). The realtime "unscaled" time measurements (e.g. `time.raw_delta_seconds()`) are mostly for debugging and profiling.

    Fix tests breaking when new WorldQuery impls are added (#6317)
    
    # Objective
    
    I recently wanted to look at the possibility of adding `Mutated` and `Unchanged` query filters and was confronted with some seemingly unrelated broken tests.
    
    These tests were written in such a way that changing the number of WorldQuery impls in the project would break them.
    
    Fortunately, a [very recent release of trybuild](https://github.com/dtolnay/trybuild/releases/tag/1.0.70) has made this unnecessary.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Replace hardcoded numbers in test output with `$N` placeholders.

    Resolves #6197
    
    Make it so that doc comments can be retrieved via reflection.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Adds the new `documentation` feature to `bevy_reflect` (disabled by default).
    
    When enabled, documentation can be found using `TypeInfo::doc` for reflected types:
    
    ```rust
    /// Some struct.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```ignore
    /// let some_struct = SomeStruct;
    /// ```
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct SomeStruct;

        info.docs()
    );
    ```
    
    ### Notes for Reviewers

    Add default implementation of Serialize and Deserialize to Timer and Stopwatch (#6248)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6244
    
    ## Solution
    
    Uses derive to implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for `Timer` and `Stopwatch`
    
    ### Things to consider
    - Should fields such as `finished` and `times_finished_this_tick` in `Timer` be serialized?
    - Does `Countdown` and `PrintOnCompletionTimer` need to be serialized and deserialized?
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Added `Serialize` and `Deserialize` implementations to `Timer` and `Stopwatch`, `Countdown`.

    Support multiple `#[reflect]`/`#[reflect_value]` + improve error messages (#6237)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, surprising behavior happens when specifying `#[reflect(...)]` or `#[reflect_value(...)]` multiple times. Rather than merging the traits lists from all attributes, only the trait list from the last attribute is used. For example, in the following code, only the `Debug` and `Hash` traits are reflected and not `Default` or `PartialEq`:
    
    ```rs
    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Hash, Default, Reflect)]
    #[reflect(PartialEq, Default)]
    #[reflect(Debug, Hash)]
    struct Foo;
    ```
    
    This is especially important when some traits should only be reflected under certain circumstances. For example, this previously had surprisingly behavior when the "serialize" feature is enabled:
    
    ```rs
    #[derive(Debug, Hash, Reflect)]
    #[reflect(Debug, Hash)]
    #[cfg_attr(
        feature = "serialize",
        derive(Serialize, Deserialize),
        reflect(Serialize, Deserialize)
    ]
    struct Foo;
    ```
    
    In addition, compile error messages generated from using the derive macro often point to the `#[derive(Reflect)]` rather than to the source of the error. It would be a lot more helpful if the compiler errors pointed to what specifically caused the error rather than just to the derive macro itself.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Merge the trait lists in all `#[reflect(...)]` and `#[reflect_value(...)]` attributes. Additionally, make `#[reflect]` and `#[reflect_value]` mutually exclusive.
    
    Additionally, span information is carried throughout some parts of the code now to ensure that error messages point to more useful places and better indicate what caused those errors. For example, `#[reflect(Hash, Hash)]` points to the second `Hash` as the source of an error. Also, in the following example, the compiler error now points to the `Hash` in `#[reflect(Hash)]` rather than to the derive macro:
    
    ```rs
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    #[reflect(Hash)] // <-- compiler error points to `Hash` for lack of a `Hash` implementation
    struct Foo;
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Changed
    - Using multiple `#[reflect(...)]` or `#[reflect_value(...)]` attributes now merges the trait lists. For example, `#[reflect(Debug, Hash)] #[reflect(PartialEq, Default)]` is equivalent to `#[reflect(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Default)]`.
      - Multiple `#[reflect(...)]` and `#[reflect_value(...)]` attributes were previously accepted, but only the last attribute was respected.
      - Using both `#[reflect(...)]` and `#[reflect_value(...)]` was previously accepted, but had surprising behavior. This is no longer accepted.
    - Improved error messages for `#[derive(Reflect)]` by propagating useful span information. Many errors should now point to the source of those errors rather than to the derive macro.

    Add getters and setters for `InputAxis` and `ButtonSettings` (#6088)
    
    # Objective
    Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3418
    
    ## Solution
    
    Originally a rebase of https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3446.  Work was originally done by mfdorst, who should receive considerable credit.  Then the error types were extensively reworked by targrub.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `AxisSettings` now has a `new()`, which may return an `AxisSettingsError`.
    `AxisSettings` fields made private; now must be accessed through getters and setters.  There's a dead zone, from `.deadzone_upperbound()` to `.deadzone_lowerbound()`, and a live zone, from `.deadzone_upperbound()` to `.livezone_upperbound()` and from `.deadzone_lowerbound()` to `.livezone_lowerbound()`.
    `AxisSettings` setters no longer panic.
    `ButtonSettings` fields made private; now must be accessed through getters and setters.
    `ButtonSettings` now has a `new()`, which may return a `ButtonSettingsError`.

    - Trying to make it possible to do write tests that don't require a raw window handle.
    - Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6106.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make the interface and type changes.  Avoid accessing `None`.
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Converted `raw_window_handle` field in both `Window` and `ExtractedWindow` to `Option<RawWindowHandleWrapper>`.
    - Revised accessor function `Window::raw_window_handle()` to return `Option<RawWindowHandleWrapper>`.
    - Skip conditions in loops that would require a raw window handle (to create a `Surface`, for example).
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `Window::raw_window_handle()` now returns `Option<RawWindowHandleWrapper>`.

    Replace the `bool` argument of `Timer` with `TimerMode` (#6247)
    
    As mentioned in #2926, it's better to have an explicit type that clearly communicates the intent of the timer mode rather than an opaque boolean, which can be only understood when knowing the signature or having to look up the documentation.
    
    This also opens up a way to merge different timers, such as `Stopwatch`, and possibly future ones, such as `DiscreteStopwatch` and `DiscreteTimer` from #2683, into one struct.

    # Objective

    ## Changelog

    Rename system chaining to system piping (#6230)
    
    # Objective
    
    > System chaining is a confusing name: it implies the ability to construct non-linear graphs, and suggests a sense of system ordering that is only incidentally true. Instead, it actually works by passing data from one system to the next, much like the pipe operator.
    
    > In the accepted [stageless RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/45-stageless.md), this concept is renamed to piping, and "system chaining" is used to construct groups of systems with ordering dependencies between them.
    
    Fixes #6225.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    System chaining has been renamed to system piping to improve clarity (and free up the name for new ordering APIs).
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The `.chain(handler_system)` method on systems is now `.pipe(handler_system)`.
    The `IntoChainSystem` trait is now `IntoPipeSystem`, and the `ChainSystem` struct is now `PipeSystem`.

    # Objective
    Fixes #5572
    
    ## Solution
    
    Approach is to invert the Y-axis of the UI Camera by changing the UI projection matrix to render the UI upside down.
    
    After that I'm trying to fix all issues, that pop up:
    - interaction expected the "old" position
    - images and text were displayed upside-down
    - baseline of text was based on the top of the glyph instead of bottom
    
    ... probably a lot more.

    Adding Debug implementations for App, Stage, Schedule, Query, QueryState, etc. (#6214)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Adding Debug implementations for App, Stage, Schedule, Query, QueryState.
    - Fixes #1130.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Implemented std::fmt::Debug for a number of structures.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Also added Debug implementations for ParallelSystemExecutor, SingleThreadedExecutor, various RunCriteria structures, SystemContainer, and SystemDescriptor.
    
    Opinions are sure to differ as to what information to provide in a Debug implementation.  Best guess was taken for this initial version for these structures.

    Add globals struct to mesh2d (#6222)
    
    See commit message.
    I noticed I couldn't use `globals.time` when using `Material2d`.
    
    I copied the solution from 807336203903e516a8705a13316c2c2c20c0f5bb , and now `Material2d` works for me.
    
    Perhaps some of these struct definitions could be shared in the future, but for now I've just copy pasted it (it looked like the `View` struct was done that way).
    
    Ping @IceSentry , I saw a comment on the linked commit that you intended to do this work at some point in the future.

    remove mandatory mesh attributes (#6127)
    
    # Objective
    
    - It's possible to create a mesh without positions or normals, but currently bevy forces these attributes to be present on any mesh.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Don't assume these attributes are present and add a shader defs for each attributes
    - I updated 2d and 3d meshes to use the same logic.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Meshes don't require any attributes
    
    # Notes
    I didn't update the pbr.wgsl shader because I'm not sure how to handle it. It doesn't really make sense to use it without positions or normals.

    bevy_input: Fix process touch event (#4352)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `process_touch_event` in `bevy_input` don't update position info. `TouchPhase::Ended` and `TouchPhase::Cancelled` should use the position info from `pressed`. Otherwise, it'll not update. The position info is updated from `TouchPhase::Moved`.

    Add a method for mapping `Mut<T>` -> `Mut<U>` (#6199)
    
    # Objective
    
    When designing an API, you may wish to provide access only to a specific field of a component or resource. The current options for doing this in safe code are
    
    * `*Mut::into_inner`, which flags a change no matter what.
    * `*Mut::bypass_change_detection`, which misses all changes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the method `map_unchanged`.
    
    ### Example
    
    ```rust
    // When run, zeroes the translation of every entity.
    fn reset_all(mut transforms: Query<&mut Transform>) {
        for transform in &mut transforms {
            // We pinky promise not to modify `t` within the closure.
            let translation = transform.map_unchanged(|t| &mut t.translation);
            // Only reset the translation if it isn't already zero.
            translation.set_if_not_equal(Vec2::ZERO);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    + Added the method `map_unchanged` to types `Mut<T>`, `ResMut<T>`, and `NonSendMut<T>`.

    Remove `Transform::apply_non_uniform_scale` (#6133)
    
    This is a holdover from back when `Transform` was backed by a private `Mat4` two years ago.
    Not particularly useful anymore :)
    
    ## Migration Guide
    `Transform::apply_non_uniform_scale` has been removed.
    It can be replaced with the following snippet:
    ```rust
    transform.scale *= scale_factor;
    ```

    # Background
    
    Incremental implementation of #4299. The code is heavily borrowed from that PR.
    
    # Objective
    
    The execution order ambiguity checker often emits false positives, since bevy is not aware of invariants upheld by the user.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Title
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    + Added methods `SystemDescriptor::ignore_all_ambiguities` and `::ambiguous_with`. These allow you to silence warnings for specific system-order ambiguities.

    // These systems technically conflict, but we don't care which order they run in.

    get proper texture format after the renderer is initialized, fix #3897 (#5413)
    
    # Objective
    There is no Srgb support on some GPU and display protocols with `winit` (for example, Nvidia's GPUs with Wayland). Thus `TextureFormat::bevy_default()` which returns `Rgba8UnormSrgb` or `Bgra8UnormSrgb` will cause panics on such platforms. This patch will resolve this problem. Fix https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3897.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Make `initialize_renderer` expose `wgpu::Adapter` and `first_available_texture_format`, use the `first_available_texture_format` by default.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Fixed https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3897.

    Make the default background color of `NodeBundle` transparent (#6211)
    
    # Objective
    
    Closes #6202.
    
    The default background color for `NodeBundle` is currently white.
    However, it's very rare that you actually want a white background color.
    Instead, you often want a background color specific to the style of your game or a transparent background (e.g. for UI layout nodes).
    
    ## Solution
    
    `Default` is not derived for `NodeBundle` anymore, but explicitly specified.
    The default background color is now transparent (`Color::NONE.into()`) as this is the most common use-case, is familiar from the web and makes specifying a layout for your UI less tedious.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Changed the default `NodeBundle.background_color` to be transparent (`Color::NONE.into()`).
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If you want a `NodeBundle` with a white background color, you must explicitly specify it:
    
    Before:
    
    ```rust
    let node = NodeBundle {
        ..default()
    }
    ```
    
    After:
    
    ```rust
    let node = NodeBundle {
        background_color: Color::WHITE.into(),
        ..default()
    }
    ```

    Fix inconsistent children removal behavior (#6017)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #6010
    
    ## Solution
    
    As discussed in #6010, this makes it so the `Children` component is removed from the entity whenever all of its children are removed. The behavior is now consistent between all of the commands that may remove children from a parent, and this is tested via two new test functions (one for world functions and one for commands).
    
    Documentation was also added to `insert_children`, `push_children`, `add_child` and `remove_children` commands to make this behavior clearer for users.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Fixed `Children` component not getting removed from entity when all its children are moved to a new parent.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Queries with `Changed<Children>` will no longer match entities that had all of their children removed using `remove_children`.
    - `RemovedComponents<Children>` will now contain entities that had all of their children remove using `remove_children`.

    Reflect Default for `ComputedVisibility` and `Handle<T>` (#6187)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Reflecting `Default` is required for scripts to create `Reflect` types at runtime with no static type information.

    Replace fixed timestep in `alien_cake_addict` example with timer (#5760)
    
    # Objective
    
    Examples should use the correct tools for the job.
    
    ## Solution
    
    A fixed timestep, by design, can step multiple times consecutively in a single update.
    
    That property used to crash the `alien_cake_addict` example (#2525), which was "fixed" in #3411 (by just not panicking). The proper fix is to use a timer instead, since the system is supposed to spawn a cake every 5 seconds.
    
    ---
    
    A timer guarantees a minimum duration. A fixed timestep guarantees a fixed number of steps per second.
    Each one works by essentially sacrificing the other's guarantee.
    
    You can use them together, but no other systems are timestep-based in this example, so the timer is enough.

    - Addresses #5960
    - Alternative to #5961
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR adds a doc comment to the method to inform the user that the returned `EntityCommands` is not guaranteed to be valid. It also adds panic doc comments on appropriate `EntityCommands` methods.

    ## Notes
    I tried calling `alpha_discard()` before the `if` in pbr.wgsl, but I had errors related to having a `discard` at the beginning before doing the texture sampling. I'm not sure if there's a way to fix that instead of having the function being called in 2 places.

    The implementation is currently split between bevy_render and bevy_pbr because I was basing my implementation on the `ViewPlugin`. I'm not sure if that's the right way to structure it.
    
    I named this `globals` instead of just time because we could potentially add more things to it.

    log pipeline cache errors earlier (#6115)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Currently, errors aren't logged as soon as they are found, they are logged only on the next frame. This means your shader could have an unreported error that could have been reported on the first frame.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Log the error as soon as they are found, don't wait until next frame
    
    ## Notes
    
    I discovered this issue because I was simply unwrapping the `Result` from `PipelinCache::get_render_pipeline()` which caused it to fail without any explanations. Admittedly, this was a bit of a user error, I shouldn't have unwrapped that, but it seems a bit strange to wait until the next time the pipeline is processed to log the error instead of just logging it as soon as possible since we already have all the info necessary.

    Nested spawns on scope (#4466)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add ability to create nested spawns. This is needed for stageless. The current executor spawns tasks for each system early and runs the system by communicating through a channel. In stageless we want to spawn the task late, so that archetypes can be updated right before the task is run. The executor is run on a separate task, so this enables the scope to be passed to the spawned executor.
    - Fixes #4301
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Instantiate a single threaded executor on the scope and use that instead of the LocalExecutor. This allows the scope to be Send, but still able to spawn tasks onto the main thread the scope is run on. This works because while systems can access nonsend data. The systems themselves are Send. Because of this change we lose the ability to spawn nonsend tasks on the scope, but I don't think this is being used anywhere. Users would still be able to use spawn_local on TaskPools.
    - Steals the lifetime tricks the `std::thread::scope` uses to allow nested spawns, but disallow scope to be passed to tasks or threads not associated with the scope.
    - Change the storage for the tasks to a `ConcurrentQueue`. This is to allow a &Scope to be passed for spawning instead of a &mut Scope. `ConcurrentQueue` was chosen because it was already in our dependency tree because `async_executor` depends on it.
    - removed the optimizations for 0 and 1 spawned tasks. It did improve those cases, but made the cases of more than 1 task slower.
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Add ability to nest spawns
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let pool = TaskPool::new();
        pool.scope(|scope| {
            scope.spawn(async move {
                // calling scope.spawn from an spawn task was not possible before
                scope.spawn(async move {
                    // do something
                });
            });
        })
    }
    ```
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If you were using explicit lifetimes and Passing Scope you'll need to specify two lifetimes now.
    
    ```rust
    fn scoped_function<'scope>(scope: &mut Scope<'scope, ()>) {}
    // should become
    fn scoped_function<'scope>(scope: &Scope<'_, 'scope, ()>) {}
    ```
    
    `scope.spawn_local` changed to `scope.spawn_on_scope` this should cover cases where you needed to run tasks on the local thread, but does not cover spawning Nonsend Futures.
    
    ## TODO
    * [x] think real hard about all the lifetimes
    * [x] add doc about what 'env and 'scope mean.
    * [x] manually check that the single threaded task pool still works
    * [x] Get updated perf numbers
    * [x] check and make sure all the transmutes are necessary
    * [x] move commented out test into a compile fail test
    * [x] look through the tests for scope on std and see if I should add any more tests

    Add additional constructors for `UiRect` to specify values for specific fields (#5988)
    
    # Objective
    
    Often one wants to create a `UiRect` with a value only specifying a single field. These ways are already available, but not the most ergonomic:
    
    ```rust
    UiRect::new(Val::Undefined, Val::Undefined, Val::Percent(25.0), Val::Undefined)
    ```
    ```rust
    UiRect {
        top: Val::Percent(25.0),
        ..default()
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Introduce 6 new constructors:
    
    - `horizontal`
    - `vertical`
    - `left`
    - `right`
    - `top`
    - `bottom`
    
    So the above code can be written instead as:
    
    ```rust
    UiRect::top(Val::Percent(25.0))
    ```
    
    This solution is similar to the style fields `margin-left`, `padding-top`, etc. that you would see in CSS, from which bevy's UI has other inspiration. Therefore, it should still feel intuitive to users coming from CSS.

    Make arrays behave like lists in reflection (#5987)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, arrays cannot indexed using the reflection path API.
    This change makes them behave like lists so `x.get_path("list[0]")` will behave the same way, whether x.list is a "List" (e.g. a Vec) or an array.
    
    ## Solution
    
    When syntax is encounterd `[ <idx> ]` we check if the referenced type is either a `ReflectRef::List` or `ReflectRef::Array`   (or `ReflectMut` for the mutable case). Since both provide the identical API for accessing entries, we do the same for both, although it requires code duplication as far as I can tell.
    
    
    This was born from working on #5764, but since this seems to be an easier fix (and I am not sure if I can actually solve #5812) I figured it might be worth to split this out.

    Exclusive Systems Now Implement `System`. Flexible Exclusive System Params (#6083)
    
    # Objective
    
    The [Stageless RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/45) involves allowing exclusive systems to be referenced and ordered relative to parallel systems. We've agreed that unifying systems under `System` is the right move.
    
    This is an alternative to #4166 (see rationale in the comments I left there). Note that this builds on the learnings established there (and borrows some patterns).
    
    ## Solution
    
    This unifies parallel and exclusive systems under the shared `System` trait, removing the old `ExclusiveSystem` trait / impls. This is accomplished by adding a new `ExclusiveFunctionSystem` impl similar to `FunctionSystem`. It is backed by `ExclusiveSystemParam`, which is similar to `SystemParam`. There is a new flattened out SystemContainer api (which cuts out a lot of trait and type complexity).
    
    This means you can remove all cases of `exclusive_system()`:
    
    ```rust
    // before
    commands.add_system(some_system.exclusive_system());
    // after
    commands.add_system(some_system);
    ```
    
    I've also implemented `ExclusiveSystemParam` for `&mut QueryState` and `&mut SystemState`, which makes this possible in exclusive systems:
    
    ```rust
    fn some_exclusive_system(
        world: &mut World,
        transforms: &mut QueryState<&Transform>,
        state: &mut SystemState<(Res<Time>, Query<&Player>)>,
    ) {
        for transform in transforms.iter(world) {
            println!("{transform:?}");
        }
        let (time, players) = state.get(world);
        for player in players.iter() {
            println!("{player:?}");
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Note that "exclusive function systems" assume `&mut World` is present (and the first param). I think this is a fair assumption, given that the presence of `&mut World` is what defines the need for an exclusive system.
    
    I added some targeted SystemParam `static` constraints, which removed the need for this:
    ``` rust
    fn some_exclusive_system(state: &mut SystemState<(Res<'static, Time>, Query<&'static Player>)>) {}
    ```

    - `ExclusiveFunctionSystem` and `ExclusiveSystemParam` were added, enabling flexible exclusive function systems
    - `&mut SystemState` and `&mut QueryState` now implement `ExclusiveSystemParam`
    - Exclusive and parallel System configuration is now done via a unified `SystemDescriptor`, `IntoSystemDescriptor`, and `SystemContainer` api.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Calling `.exclusive_system()` is no longer required (or supported) for converting exclusive system functions to exclusive systems:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (0.8)
    app.add_system(some_exclusive_system.exclusive_system());
    // New (0.9)
    app.add_system(some_exclusive_system);
    ```
    
    Converting "normal" parallel systems to exclusive systems is done by calling the exclusive ordering apis:
    
    ```rust
    // Old (0.8)
    app.add_system(some_system.exclusive_system().at_end());
    // New (0.9)
    app.add_system(some_system.at_end());
    ```
    
    Query state in exclusive systems can now be cached via ExclusiveSystemParams, which should be preferred for clarity and performance reasons:
    ```rust
    // Old (0.8)
    fn some_system(world: &mut World) {
      let mut transforms = world.query::<&Transform>();
      for transform in transforms.iter(world) {
      }
    }
    // New (0.9)
    fn some_system(world: &mut World, transforms: &mut QueryState<&Transform>) {
      for transform in transforms.iter(world) {
      }
    }
    ```

    Don't use the UIBundle's Transform Fields (#6095)
    
    # Objective
    
    I was working with the TextBundle component bundle because I wanted to change the position of the text that the bundle was holding. I used the transform field on the TextBundle at first because that is normally what controls the position of sprites in Bevy and that's what I was used to working with.
    
    But the actual way to change the position of text inside of a TextBundle is to use the Style's position field, not the TextBundle's transform field.
    
    Anecdotally, it was mentioned on the discord that other users have had this issue too.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I added a small doc comment to the TextBundle's transform telling users not to use it to set the position of text. And since this issue applies to the other UI bundles, I added comments there as well!

    Rename shapes examples for consistency (#6082)
    
    # Objective
    
    I was about to submit a PR to add these two examples to `bevy-website` and re-discovered the inconsistency.
    
    Although it's not a major issue on the website where only the filenames are shown, this would help to visually distinguish the two examples in the list  because the names are very prominent.
    
    This also helps out when fuzzy-searching the codebase for these files.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Rename `shapes` to `2d_shapes`. Now the filename matches the example name, and the naming structure matches the 3d example.
    
    ## Notes
    
    @Nilirad proposed this in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4613#discussion_r862455631 but it had slipped away from my brain at that time.

    Merge TextureAtlas::from_grid_with_padding into TextureAtlas::from_grid through option arguments (#6057)
    
    This is an adoption of #3775
    This merges `TextureAtlas` `from_grid_with_padding` into `from_grid` , adding optional padding and optional offset.
    Since the orignal PR, the offset had already been added to from_grid_with_padding through #4836
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added `padding` and `offset` arguments to  `TextureAtlas::from_grid`
    - Removed `TextureAtlas::from_grid_with_padding`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `TextureAtlas::from_grid_with_padding` was merged into `from_grid` which takes two additional parameters for padding and an offset.
    ```
    // 0.8
    TextureAtlas::from_grid(texture_handle, Vec2::new(24.0, 24.0), 7, 1);

     add time wrapping to Time (#5982)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Sometimes, like when using shaders, you can only use a time value in `f32`. Unfortunately this suffers from floating precision issues pretty quickly. The standard approach to this problem is to wrap the time after a given period
    - This is necessary for https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5409
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `seconds_since_last_wrapping_period` method on `Time` that returns a `f32` that is the `seconds_since_startup` modulo the `max_wrapping_period`
    
    ---

    Spawn now takes a Bundle (#6054)
    
    # Objective
    
    Now that we can consolidate Bundles and Components under a single insert (thanks to #2975 and #6039), almost 100% of world spawns now look like `world.spawn().insert((Some, Tuple, Here))`. Spawning an entity without any components is an extremely uncommon pattern, so it makes sense to give spawn the "first class" ergonomic api. This consolidated api should be made consistent across all spawn apis (such as World and Commands).
    
    ## Solution
    
    All `spawn` apis (`World::spawn`, `Commands:;spawn`, `ChildBuilder::spawn`, and `WorldChildBuilder::spawn`) now accept a bundle as input:
    
    ```rust
    // before:
    commands
      .spawn()
      .insert((A, B, C));
    world
      .spawn()
      .insert((A, B, C);
    
    // after
    commands.spawn((A, B, C));
    world.spawn((A, B, C));
    ```
    
    All existing instances of `spawn_bundle` have been deprecated in favor of the new `spawn` api. A new `spawn_empty` has been added, replacing the old `spawn` api.
    
    By allowing `world.spawn(some_bundle)` to replace `world.spawn().insert(some_bundle)`, this opened the door to removing the initial entity allocation in the "empty" archetype / table done in `spawn()` (and subsequent move to the actual archetype in `.insert(some_bundle)`).
    
    This improves spawn performance by over 10%:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2694663/191627587-4ab2f949-4ccd-4231-80eb-80dd4d9ad6b9.png)
    
    To take this measurement, I added a new `world_spawn` benchmark.
    
    Unfortunately, optimizing `Commands::spawn` is slightly less trivial, as Commands expose the Entity id of spawned entities prior to actually spawning. Doing the optimization would (naively) require assurances that the `spawn(some_bundle)` command is applied before all other commands involving the entity (which would not necessarily be true, if memory serves). Optimizing `Commands::spawn` this way does feel possible, but it will require careful thought (and maybe some additional checks), which deserves its own PR. For now, it has the same performance characteristics of the current `Commands::spawn_bundle` on main.
    
    **Note that 99% of this PR is simple renames and refactors. The only code that needs careful scrutiny is the new `World::spawn()` impl, which is relatively straightforward, but it has some new unsafe code (which re-uses battle tested BundlerSpawner code path).**
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - All `spawn` apis (`World::spawn`, `Commands:;spawn`, `ChildBuilder::spawn`, and `WorldChildBuilder::spawn`) now accept a bundle as input
    - All instances of `spawn_bundle` have been deprecated in favor of the new `spawn` api
    - World and Commands now have `spawn_empty()`, which is equivalent to the old `spawn()` behavior.
    
    ## Migration Guide

    Derive `FromReflect` for `Transform` and `GlobalTransform`.
    
    I thought if I should also derive `FromReflect` for `GlobalTransform`, since it's a computed component, but there may be some use cases where a `GlobalTransform` is needed to be sent over the wire, so I decided to do it.

    ```rust
    // Old (0.8)
    commands.entity(some_entity).remove_bundle::<SomeBundle>();
    // New (0.9)
    commands.entity(some_entity).remove::<SomeBundle>();
    ```
    
    Replace `remove_bundle_intersection` with `remove_intersection`:
    ```rust
    // Old (0.8)
    world.entity_mut(some_entity).remove_bundle_intersection::<SomeBundle>();
    // New (0.9)
    world.entity_mut(some_entity).remove_intersection::<SomeBundle>();
    ```
    
    Consider consolidating as many operations as possible to improve ergonomics and cut down on archetype moves:
    ```rust
    // Old (0.8)
    commands.spawn()
      .insert_bundle(SomeBundle::default())
      .insert(SomeComponent);
    
    // New (0.9) - Option 1
    commands.spawn().insert((
      SomeBundle::default(),
      SomeComponent,

    // New (0.9) - Option 2
    commands.spawn_bundle((
      SomeBundle::default(),
      SomeComponent,
    ))
    ```
    
    ## Next Steps
    
    Consider changing `spawn` to accept a bundle and deprecate `spawn_bundle`.

    Fix API docs for `Commands` methods (#5955)
    
    # Objective
    
    The doc comments for `Command` methods are a bit inconsistent on the format, they sometimes go out of scope, and most importantly they are wrong, in the sense that they claim to perform the action described by the command, while in reality, they just push a command to perform the action.
    
    - Follow-up of #5938.
    - Related to #5913.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Where applicable, only stated that a `Command` is pushed.
    - Added a “See also” section for similar methods.
    - Added a missing “Panics” section for `Commands::entity`.
    - Removed a wrong comment about `Commands::get_or_spawn` returning `None` (It does not return an option).
    - Removed polluting descriptions of other items.
    - Misc formatting changes.
    
    ## Future possibilities
    
    Since the `Command` implementors (`Spawn`, `InsertBundle`, `InitResource`, ...) are public, I thought that it might be appropriate to describe the action of the command there instead of the method, and to add a `method → command struct` link to fill the gap.
    
    If that seems too far-fetched, we may opt to make them private, if possible, or `#[doc(hidden)]`.

    # Objective
    
    - Fix #2974

    - Follow up commits do steps to prove that this method works to unify as required, but this does not remove `insert_bundle`.

    ### Changed
    Nested bundles now collapse automatically, and every `Component` now implements `Bundle`.
    This means that you can combine bundles and components arbitrarily, for example:
    ```rust
    // before:
    .insert(A).insert_bundle(MyBBundle{..})
    // after:
    .insert_bundle((A, MyBBundle {..}))
    ```
    
    Note that there will be a follow up PR that removes the current `insert` impl and renames `insert_bundle` to `insert`.
    
    ### Removed
    The `bundle` attribute in `derive(Bundle)`.
    
    ## Migration guide
    
    In `derive(Bundle)`, the `bundle` attribute has been removed. Nested bundles are not collapsed automatically. You should remove `#[bundle]` attributes.

    bevy_reflect: Improve serialization format even more (#5723)
    
    > Note: This is rebased off #4561 and can be viewed as a competitor to that PR. See `Comparison with #4561` section for details.
    
    # Objective
    
    The current serialization format used by `bevy_reflect` is both verbose and error-prone. Taking the following structs[^1] for example:
    
    ```rust
    // -- src/inventory.rs
    
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct Inventory {
      id: String,
      max_storage: usize,
      items: Vec<Item>
    }
    
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct Item {
      name: String
    }
    ```
    
    Given an inventory of a single item, this would serialize to something like:
    
    ```rust
    // -- assets/inventory.ron
    
    {
      "type": "my_game::inventory::Inventory",
      "struct": {
        "id": {
          "type": "alloc::string::String",
          "value": "inv001",
        },
        "max_storage": {
          "type": "usize",
          "value": 10
        },
        "items": {
          "type": "alloc::vec::Vec<alloc::string::String>",
          "list": [
            {
              "type": "my_game::inventory::Item",
              "struct": {
                "name": {
                  "type": "alloc::string::String",
                  "value": "Pickaxe"
                },
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    }
    ```
    
    Aside from being really long and difficult to read, it also has a few "gotchas" that users need to be aware of if they want to edit the file manually. A major one is the requirement that you use the proper keys for a given type. For structs, you need `"struct"`. For lists, `"list"`. For tuple structs, `"tuple_struct"`. And so on.
    
    It also ***requires*** that the `"type"` entry come before the actual data. Despite being a map— which in programming is almost always orderless by default— the entries need to be in a particular order. Failure to follow the ordering convention results in a failure to deserialize the data.
    
    This makes it very prone to errors and annoyances.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    Using #4042, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate and metadata needed by this older system. Since we now have static access to type information, we can simplify our serialized data to look like:
    
    ```rust
    // -- assets/inventory.ron
    
    {
      "my_game::inventory::Inventory": (
        id: "inv001",
        max_storage: 10,
        items: [
          (
            name: "Pickaxe"
          ),
        ],
      ),
    }
    ```
    
    This is much more digestible and a lot less error-prone (no more key requirements and no more extra type names).
    
    Additionally, it is a lot more familiar to users as it follows conventional serde mechanics. For example, the struct is represented with `(...)` when serialized to RON.
    
    #### Custom Serialization
    
    Additionally, this PR adds the opt-in ability to specify a custom serde implementation to be used rather than the one created via reflection. For example[^1]:
    
    ```rust
    // -- src/inventory.rs
    
    #[derive(Reflect, Serialize)]
    #[reflect(Serialize)]
    struct Item {
      #[serde(alias = "id")]
      name: String
    }
    ```
    
    ```rust
    // -- assets/inventory.ron
    
    {
      "my_game::inventory::Inventory": (
        id: "inv001",
        max_storage: 10,
        items: [
          (
            id: "Pickaxe"
          ),
        ],
      ),
    },
    ```
    
    By allowing users to define their own serialization methods, we do two things:
    
    1. We give more control over how data is serialized/deserialized to the end user
    2. We avoid having to re-define serde's attributes and forcing users to apply both (e.g. we don't need a `#[reflect(alias)]` attribute).
    
    ### Improved Formats
    
    One of the improvements this PR provides is the ability to represent data in ways that are more conventional and/or familiar to users. Many users are familiar with RON so here are some of the ways we can now represent data in RON:
    
    ###### Structs
    
    ```js
    {
      "my_crate::Foo": (
        bar: 123
      )
    }
    // OR
    {
      "my_crate::Foo": Foo(
        bar: 123
      )
    }
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary>Old Format</summary>
    
    ```js
    {
      "type": "my_crate::Foo",
      "struct": {
        "bar": {
          "type": "usize",
          "value": 123
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    </details>
    
    ###### Tuples
    
    ```js
    {
      "(f32, f32)": (1.0, 2.0)
    }
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary>Old Format</summary>
    
    ```js
    {
      "type": "(f32, f32)",
      "tuple": [
        {
          "type": "f32",
          "value": 1.0
        },
        {
          "type": "f32",
          "value": 2.0
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    </details>
    
    ###### Tuple Structs
    
    ```js
    {
      "my_crate::Bar": ("Hello World!")
    }
    // OR
    {
      "my_crate::Bar": Bar("Hello World!")
    }
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary>Old Format</summary>
    
    ```js
    {
      "type": "my_crate::Bar",
      "tuple_struct": [
        {
          "type": "alloc::string::String",
          "value": "Hello World!"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    </details>
    
    ###### Arrays
    
    It may be a bit surprising to some, but arrays now also use the tuple format. This is because they essentially _are_ tuples (a sequence of values with a fixed size), but only allow for homogenous types. Additionally, this is how RON handles them and is probably a result of the 32-capacity limit imposed on them (both by [serde](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Serialize.html#impl-Serialize-for-%5BT%3B%2032%5D) and by [bevy_reflect](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/reflect/trait.GetTypeRegistration.html#impl-GetTypeRegistration-for-%5BT%3B%2032%5D)).
    
    ```js
    {
      "[i32; 3]": (1, 2, 3)
    }
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary>Old Format</summary>
    
    ```js
    {
      "type": "[i32; 3]",
      "array": [
        {
          "type": "i32",
          "value": 1
        },
        {
          "type": "i32",
          "value": 2
        },
        {
          "type": "i32",
          "value": 3
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    </details>
    
    ###### Enums
    
    To make things simple, I'll just put a struct variant here, but the style applies to all variant types:
    
    ```js
    {
      "my_crate::ItemType": Consumable(
        name: "Healing potion"
      )
    }
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary>Old Format</summary>
    
    ```js
    {
      "type": "my_crate::ItemType",
      "enum": {
        "variant": "Consumable",
        "struct": {
          "name": {
            "type": "alloc::string::String",
            "value": "Healing potion"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    </details>
    
    ### Comparison with #4561
    
    This PR is a rebased version of #4561. The reason for the split between the two is because this PR creates a _very_ different scene format. You may notice that the PR descriptions for either PR are pretty similar. This was done to better convey the changes depending on which (if any) gets merged first. If #4561 makes it in first, I will update this PR description accordingly.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Re-worked serialization/deserialization for reflected types
    * Added `TypedReflectDeserializer` for deserializing data with known `TypeInfo`
    * Renamed `ReflectDeserializer` to `UntypedReflectDeserializer`
    * ~~Replaced usages of `deserialize_any` with `deserialize_map` for non-self-describing formats~~ Reverted this change since there are still some issues that need to be sorted out (in a separate PR). By reverting this, crates like `bincode` can throw an error when attempting to deserialize non-self-describing formats (`bincode` results in `DeserializeAnyNotSupported`)
    * Structs, tuples, tuple structs, arrays, and enums are now all de/serialized using conventional serde methods
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    * This PR reduces the verbosity of the scene format. Scenes will need to be updated accordingly:
    
    ```js
    // Old format
    {
      "type": "my_game::item::Item",
      "struct": {
        "id": {
          "type": "alloc::string::String",
          "value": "bevycraft:stone",
        },
        "tags": {
          "type": "alloc::vec::Vec<alloc::string::String>",
          "list": [
            {
              "type": "alloc::string::String",
              "value": "material"
            },
          ],
        },
    }
    
    // New format
    {
      "my_game::item::Item": (
        id: "bevycraft:stone",
        tags: ["material"]
      )
    }
    ```

    Derived `Copy` trait for `bevy_input` events, `Serialize`/`Deserialize` for events in `bevy_input` and `bevy_windows`, `PartialEq` for events in both, and `Eq` where possible in both. (#6023)
    
    # Objective
    
    Add traits to events in `bevy_input` and `bevy_windows`: `Copy`, `Serialize`/`Deserialize`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq`, as requested in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6022, https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6023, https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6024.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added the traits to events in `bevy_input` and `bevy_windows`.  Added dependency of `serde` in `Cargo.toml` of `bevy_input`.
    
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If one has been `.clone()`'ing `bevy_input` events, Clippy will now complain about that.  Just remove `.clone()` to solve.
    
    ## Other Notes
    
    Some events in `bevy_input` had `f32` fields, so `Eq` trait was not derived for them.
    Some events in `bevy_windows` had `String` fields, so `Copy` trait was not derived for them.

    Remove `AssetServer::watch_for_changes()` (#5968)
    
    # Objective
    `AssetServer::watch_for_changes()` is racy and redundant with `AssetServerSettings`.
    Closes #5964.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Remove `AssetServer::watch_for_changes()`
    * Add `AssetServerSettings` to the prelude.
    * Minor cleanup.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    `AssetServer::watch_for_changes()` was removed.
    Instead, use the `AssetServerSettings` resource.
    ```rust
    app // AssetServerSettings must be inserted before adding the AssetPlugin or DefaultPlugins.
            .insert_resource(AssetServerSettings {
                    watch_for_changes: true,

    Limit FontAtlasSets  (#5708)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5636
    Summary: The FontAtlasSet caches generated font textures per font size. Since font size can be any arbitrary floating point number it is possible for the user to generate thousands of font texture inadvertently by changing the font size over time. This results in a memory leak as these generated font textures fill the available memory.
    
    ## Solution
    
    We limit the number of possible font sizes that we will cache and throw an error if the user attempts to generate more. This error encourages the user to use alternative, less performance intensive methods to accomplish the same goal. If the user requires more font sizes and the alternative solutions wont work there is now a TextSettings Resource that the user can set to configure this limit.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    The number of cached font sizes per font is now limited with a default limit of 100 font sizes per font. This limit is configurable via the new TextSettings struct.

    Add warning when a hierarchy component is missing (#5590)
    
    # Objective
    
    A common pitfall since 0.8 is the requirement on `ComputedVisibility`
    being present on all ancestors of an entity that itself has
    `ComputedVisibility`, without which, the entity becomes invisible.
    
    I myself hit the issue and got very confused, and saw a few people hit
    it as well, so it makes sense to provide a hint of what to do when such
    a situation is encountered.
    
    - Fixes #5849
    - Closes #5616
    - Closes #2277
    - Closes #5081
    
    ## Solution
    
    We now check that all entities with both a `Parent` and a
    `ComputedVisibility` component have parents that themselves have a
    `ComputedVisibility` component.
    
    Note that the warning is only printed once.
    
    We also add a similar warning to `GlobalTransform`.
    
    This only emits a warning. Because sometimes it could be an intended
    behavior.
    
    Alternatives:
    - Do nothing and keep repeating to newcomers how to avoid recurring
      pitfalls
    - Make the transform and visibility propagation tolerant to missing
      components (#5616)
    - Probably archetype invariants, though the current draft would not
      allow detecting that kind of errors

    Add `reflect(skip_serializing)` which retains reflection but disables automatic serialization (#5250)
    
    # Objective
    
    - To address problems outlined in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/5245
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Introduce `reflect(skip_serializing)` on top of `reflect(ignore)` which disables automatic serialisation to scenes, but does not disable reflection of the field.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    - Adds:
      - `bevy_reflect::serde::type_data` module
      - `SerializationData` structure for describing which fields are to be/not to be ignored, automatically registers as type_data for struct-based types
      - the `skip_serialization` flag for `#[reflect(...)]`
     - Removes:
       - ability to ignore Enum variants in serialization, since that didn't work anyway
    
    
    ## Migration Guide
    - Change `#[reflect(ignore)]` to `#[reflect(skip_serializing)]` where disabling reflection is not the intended effect.
    - Remove ignore/skip attributes from enum variants as these won't do anything anymore

    Swap out num_cpus for std::thread::available_parallelism (#4970)
    
    # Objective
    As of Rust 1.59, `std::thread::available_parallelism` has been stabilized. As of Rust 1.61, the API matches `num_cpus::get` by properly handling Linux's cgroups and other sandboxing mechanisms.
    
    As bevy does not have an established MSRV, we can replace `num_cpus` in `bevy_tasks` and reduce our dependency tree by one dep.
    
    ## Solution
    Replace `num_cpus` with `std::thread::available_parallelism`. Wrap it to have a fallback in the case it errors out and have it operate in the same manner as `num_cpus` did.
    
    This however removes `physical_core_count` from the API, though we are currently not using it in any way in first-party crates.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Changed: `bevy_tasks::logical_core_count` -> `bevy_tasks::available_parallelism`.
    Removed: `bevy_tasks::physical_core_count`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    `bevy_tasks::logical_core_count` and `bevy_tasks::physical_core_count` have been removed. `logical_core_count` has been replaced with `bevy_tasks::available_parallelism`, which works identically. If `bevy_tasks::physical_core_count` is required, the `num_cpus` crate can be used directly, as these two were just aliases for `num_cpus` APIs.

    `Query` filter types must be `ReadOnlyWorldQuery` (#6008)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes Issue #6005.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Replaced WorldQuery with ReadOnlyWorldQuery on F generic in Query filters and QueryState to restrict its trait bound.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Query filter (`F`) generics are now bound by `ReadOnlyWorldQuery`, rather than `WorldQuery`. If for some reason you were requesting `Query<&A, &mut B>`, please use `Query<&A, With<B>>` instead.

    Sprite: allow using a sub-region (Rect) of the image (#6014)
    
    Very small change that improves the usability of `Sprite`.
    
    Before this PR, the only way to render a portion of an `Image` was to create a `TextureAtlas` and use `TextureAtlasSprite`/`SpriteSheetBundle`. This can be very annoying for one-off use cases, like if you just want to remove a border from an image, or something. Using `Sprite`/`SpriteBundle` always meant that the entire full image would be rendered.
    
    This PR adds an optional `rect` field to `Sprite`, allowing a sub-rectangle of the image to be rendered. This is similar to how texture atlases work, but does not require creating a texture atlas asset, making it much more convenient and efficient for quick one-off use cases.
    
    Given how trivial this change is, it really felt like missing functionality in Bevy's sprites API. ;)
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Added:
     - `rect` field on `Sprite`: allows rendering a portion of the sprite's image; more convenient for one-off use cases, than creating a texture atlas.

    adjust cluster index for viewport origin (#5947)
    
    # Objective
    
    fixes #5946
    
    ## Solution
    
    adjust cluster index calculation for viewport origin.
    
    from reading point 2 of the rasterization algorithm description in https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#rasterization, it looks like framebuffer space (and so @bulitin(position)) is not meant to be adjusted for viewport origin, so we need to subtract that to get the right cluster index.
    
    - add viewport origin to rust `ExtractedView` and wgsl `View` structs
    - subtract from frag coord for cluster index calculation

    # Objective
    
    Currently some TextureFormats are not supported by the Image type.
    The `TextureFormat::Rg16Unorm` format is useful for storing minmax heightmaps.
    Similar to #5249 I now additionally require image to support the dual channel variant.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added `TextureFormat::Rg16Unorm` support to Image.
    
    Additionally this PR derives `Resource` for `SpecializedComputePipelines`, because for some reason this was missing.
    All other special pipelines do derive `Resource` already.

    Start running systems while prepare_systems is running (#4919)
    
    # Objective
    While using the ParallelExecutor, systems do not actually start until `prepare_systems` completes. In stages where there are large numbers of "empty" systems with very little work to do, this delay adds significant overhead, which can add up over many stages.
    
    ## Solution
    Immediately and synchronously signal the start of systems that can run without dependencies inside `prepare_systems` instead of waiting for the first executor iteration after `prepare_systems` completes. Any system that is dependent on them still cannot run until after `prepare_systems` completes, but there are a large number of unconstrained systems in the base engine where this is a general benefit in almost every case.
    
    ## Performance
    
    This change was tested against `many_foxes` in the default configuration. As this change is sensitive to the overhead around scheduling systems, the spans for measuring system timing, system overhead, and system commands were all commented out for these measurements.
    
    The median stage timings between `main` and this PR are as follows:
    
    |stage|main|this PR|
    |:--|:--|:--|
    |First|75.54 us|61.61 us|
    |LoadAssets|51.05 us|42.32 us|
    |PreUpdate|54.6 us|55.56 us|
    |Update|61.89 us|51.5 us|
    |PostUpdate|7.27 ms|6.71 ms|
    |AssetEvents|47.82 us|35.95 us|
    |Last|39.19 us|37.71 us|
    |reserve_and_flush|57.83 us|48.2 us|
    |Extract|1.41 ms|1.28 ms|
    |Prepare|554.49 us|502.53 us|
    |Queue|216.29 us|207.51 us|
    |Sort|67.03 us|60.99 us|
    |Render|1.73 ms|1.58 ms|
    |Cleanup|33.55 us|30.76 us|
    |Clear Entities|18.56 us|17.05 us|
    |**full frame**|**11.9 ms**|**10.91 ms**|
    
    For the first few stages, the benefit is small but cumulative over each. For PostUpdate in particular, this allows `parent_update` to run while prepare_systems is running, which is required for the animation and transform propagation systems, which dominate the time spent in the stage, but also frontloads the contention as the other "empty" systems are also running while `parent_update` is running. For Render, where there is just a single large exclusive system, the benefit comes from not waiting on a spuriously scheduled task on the task pool to kick off the system: it's immediately scheduled to run.

    Remove `Sync` bound from `Local` (#5483)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, `Local` has a `Sync` bound. Theoretically this is unnecessary as a local can only ever be accessed from its own system, ensuring exclusive access on one thread. This PR removes this restriction.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - By removing the `Resource` bound from `Local` and adding the new `SyncCell` threading primative, `Local` can have the `Sync` bound removed.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    - Added `SyncCell` to `bevy_utils`
    
    ### Changed
    
    - Removed `Resource` bound from `Local`
    - `Local` is now wrapped in a `SyncCell`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Any code relying on `Local<T>` having `T: Resource` may have to be changed, but this is unlikely.

    # Objective
    
    - Make people stop believing that commands are applied immediately (hopefully).
    - Close #5913.
    - Alternative to #5930.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I added the clause “to perform impactful changes to the `World`” to the first line to subliminally help the reader accept the fact that some operations cannot be performed immediately without messing up everything.
    
    Then I explicitely said that applying a command requires exclusive `World` access, and finally I proceeded to show when these commands are automatically applied.
    
    I also added a brief paragraph about how commands can be applied manually, if they want.
    
    ---
    
    ### Further possibilities
    
    If you agree, we can also change the text of the method documentation (in a separate PR) to stress about enqueueing an action instead of just performing it. For example, in `Commands::spawn`:
    
    > Creates a new `Entity`
    
    would be changed to something like:
    
    > Issues a `Command` to spawn a new `Entity`
    
    This may even have a greater effect, since when typing in an IDE, the docs of the method pop up and the programmer can read them on the fly.

    Add writing of scene data to Scene example (#5949)
    
    # Objective
    
    Alice says to make this PR: https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/745805740274614303/1018554340841107477
    
    - The "scene" example in the examples folder has a TODO comment about writing the serialized data to a file. This PR implements that.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The `AssetIo` trait in the `AssetServer` only supports reading data, not writing it. So, I used `std::io::File` for the implementation. This way, every time you run the example, it will mutate the file in-place.
    
    I had thought about adding a UUID string to the example Component, so that every time you run the example, the file will be guaranteed to change (currently, it just writes the same numbers over and over). However, I didn't bother because it was beyond the scope of the TODO comment.
    
    One thing to note is that the logic for serializing the scene into RON data has changed since the existing RON file was created, and so even though the data is the same, it's rendered in a different order for whatever reason.
    
    I left the changed output to the example file, because it's presumably trivial.  I can remove it and force-push if you don't want that included in here.

    Add a change detection bypass and manual control over change ticks (#5635)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Our existing change detection API is not flexible enough for advanced users: particularly those attempting to do rollback networking.
    - This is an important use case, and with adequate warnings we can make mucking about with change ticks scary enough that users generally won't do it.
    - Fixes #5633.
    - Closes #2363.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - added `ChangeDetection::set_last_changed` to manually mutate the `last_change_ticks` field"
    - the `ChangeDetection` trait now requires an `Inner` associated type, which contains the value being wrapped.
    - added `ChangeDetection::bypass_change_detection`, which hands out a raw `&mut Inner`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Add the `Inner` associated type and new methods to any type that you've implemented `DetectChanges` for.

    implement `Reflect` for `Input<T>`, some misc improvements to reflect value derive (#5676)
    
    # Objective
    
    - I'm currently working on being able to call methods on reflect types (https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy_reflect_fns)
    - for that, I'd like to add methods to the `Input<KeyCode>` resource (which I'm doing by registering type data)
    - implementing `Reflect` is currently a requirement for having type data in the `TypeRegistry`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - derive `Reflect` for `KeyCode` and `Input`
    - uses `#[reflect_value]` for `Input`, since it's fields aren't supposed to be observable
    - using reflect_value would need `Clone` bounds on `T`, but since all the methods (`.pressed` etc) already require `T: Copy`, I unified everything to requiring `Copy`
    - add `Send + Sync + 'static` bounds, also required by reflect derive
    
    ## Unrelated improvements
    I can extract into a separate PR if needed.
    
    - the `Reflect` derive would previously ignore `#[reflect_value]` and only accept `#[reflect_value()]` which was a bit confusing
    - the generated code used `val.clone()` on a reference, which is fine if `val` impls `Clone`, but otherwise also compiles with a worse error message. Change to `std::clone::Clone::clone(val)` instead which gives a neat `T does not implement Clone` error

    Update WorldQueryGats doc with type aliases (#5898)
    
    Make API users aware that the type aliases `QueryItem` and `QueryFetch` can be used instead of the more bloated alternative with `WorldQueryGats`.
    
    Fixes #5842

    make TextLayoutInfo a Component (#4460)
    
    # Objective
    
    Make `TextLayoutInfo` more accessible as a component, rather than internal to `TextPipeline`. I am working on a plugin that manipulates these and there is no (mutable) access to them right now.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This changes `TextPipeline::queue_text` to return `TextLayoutInfo`'s rather than storing them in a map internally. `text2d_system` and `text_system` now take the returned `TextLayoutInfo` and store it as a component of the entity. I considered adding an accessor to `TextPipeline` (e.g. `get_glyphs_mut`) but this seems like it might be a little faster, and also has the added benefit of cleaning itself up when entities are removed. Right now nothing is ever removed from the glyphs map.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Removed `DefaultTextPipeline`. `TextPipeline` no longer has a generic key type. `TextPipeline::queue_text` returns `TextLayoutInfo` directly.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    This might break a third-party crate? I could restore the orginal TextPipeline API as a wrapper around what's in this PR.

    disable window pre creation for ios (#5883)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5882
    
    ## Solution
    
    Per https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1705, the root cause is "UIWindow should be created inside UIApplicationMain". Currently, there are two places to create UIWindow, one is Plugin's build function, which is not inside UIApplicationMain. Just comment it out, and it works.

     Support monitor selection for all window modes. (#5878)
    
    # Objective
    Support monitor selection for all window modes.
    Fixes #5875.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Moved `MonitorSelection` out of `WindowPosition::Centered`, into `WindowDescriptor`.
    * `WindowPosition::At` is now relative to the monitor instead of being in 'desktop space'.
    * Renamed `MonitorSelection::Number` to `MonitorSelection::Index` for clarity.
    * Added `WindowMode` to the prelude.
    * `Window::set_position` is now relative to a monitor and takes a `MonitorSelection` as argument.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `MonitorSelection` was moved out of `WindowPosition::Centered`, into `WindowDescriptor`.
    `MonitorSelection::Number` was renamed to `MonitorSelection::Index`.
    ```rust
    // Before
    .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {
        position: WindowPosition::Centered(MonitorSelection::Number(1)),
        ..default()
    })
    // After
    .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {
        monitor: MonitorSelection::Index(1),
        position: WindowPosition::Centered,
        ..default()
    })
    ```
    `Window::set_position` now takes a `MonitorSelection` as argument.
    ```rust
    window.set_position(MonitorSelection::Current, position);
    ```

    Clean up taffy nodes when UI node entities are removed (#5886)
    
    # Objective
    
    Clean up taffy nodes when the associated UI node gets removed. The current UI code will keep the taffy nodes around forever.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use `RemovedComponents<Node>` to iterate over nodes that are no longer valid UI nodes or that have been despawned, and remove them from taffy and the internal hash map.
    
    ## Implementation Notes
    
    Do note that using `despawn()` instead of `despawn_recursive()` on a UI node that has children will result in a [warnings spam](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_ui/src/flex/mod.rs#L120) since the children will not be part of a proper UI hierarchy anymore.

    `Gamepad` type is `Copy`; do not require / return references to it in `Gamepads` API (#5296)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The `Gamepad` type is a tiny value-containing type that implements `Copy`.
    - By convention, references to `Copy` types should be avoided, as they can introduce overhead and muddle the semantics of what's going on.
    - This allows us to reduce boilerplate reference manipulation and lifetimes in user facing code.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make assorted methods on `Gamepads` take / return a raw `Gamepad`, rather than `&Gamepad`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - `Gamepads::iter` now returns an iterator of `Gamepad`. rather than an iterator of `&Gamepad`.
    - `Gamepads::contains` now accepts a `Gamepad`, rather than a `&Gamepad`.

    Expose `Image` conversion functions (fixes #5452) (#5527)
    
    ## Solution
    Exposes the image <-> "texture" as methods on `Image`.
    
    ## Extra
    I'm wondering if `image_texture_conversion.rs` should be renamed to `image_conversion.rs`. That or the file be deleted altogether in favour of putting the code alongside the rest of the `Image` impl. Its kind-of weird to refer to the `Image`  as a texture.
    
    Also `Image::convert` is a public method so I didn't want to edit its signature, but it might be nice to have the function consume the image instead of just passing a reference to it because it would eliminate a clone.
    
    ## Changelog
    > Rename `image_to_texture` to `Image::from_dynamic`
    > Rename `texture_to_image` to `Image::try_into_dynamic`
    > `Image::try_into_dynamic` now returns a `Result` (this is to make it easier for users who didn't read that only a few conversions are supported to figure it out.)

    Move `sprite::Rect` into `bevy_math` (#5686)
    
    # Objective
    
    Promote the `Rect` utility of `sprite::Rect`, which defines a rectangle
    by its minimum and maximum corners, to the `bevy_math` crate to make it
    available as a general math type to all crates without the need to
    depend on the `bevy_sprite` crate.
    
    Fixes #5575
    
    ## Solution
    
    Move `sprite::Rect` into `bevy_math` and fix all uses.
    
    Implement `Reflect` for `Rect` directly into the `bevy_reflect` crate by
    having `bevy_reflect` depend on `bevy_math`. This looks like a new
    dependency, but the `bevy_reflect` was "cheating" for other math types
    by directly depending on `glam` to reflect other math types, thereby
    giving the illusion that there was no dependency on `bevy_math`. In
    practice conceptually Bevy's math types are reflected into the
    `bevy_reflect` crate to avoid a dependency of that crate to a "lower
    level" utility crate like `bevy_math` (which in turn would make
    `bevy_reflect` be a dependency of most other crates, and increase the
    risk of circular dependencies). So this change simply formalizes that
    dependency in `Cargo.toml`.
    
    The `Rect` struct is also augmented in this change with a collection of
    utility methods to improve its usability. A few uses cases are updated
    to use those new methods, resulting is more clear and concise syntax.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - Moved the `sprite::Rect` type into `bevy_math`.
    
    ### Added
    
    - Added several utility methods to the `math::Rect` type.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The `bevy::sprite::Rect` type moved to the math utility crate as
    `bevy::math::Rect`. You should change your imports from `use
    bevy::sprite::Rect` to `use bevy::math::Rect`.

    # Objective
    
    - Easier to work with model assets
    - Models are often one mesh, many textures. This can be hard to use in Bevy as it's not possible to clone the scene to have one scene for each material. It's still possible to instantiate the texture-less scene, then modify the texture material once spawned but that means happening during play and is quite more painful
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Expose the code to clone a scene. This code already existed but was only possible to use to spawn the scene

    Extend the scope of Gamepad to accommodate devices that have more inputs than a typical controller.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add additional enum variants to both _GamepadButtonType_ and _GamepadAxisType_ that supports up to 255 more non-standard buttons/axis respectively.
    
    ## Personal motivation
    
    I have been writing an alternative to the GILRS crate, and with this simple change to the source code, It will be a trivial thing to direct new devices through the bevy systems, even when they do not always behave exactly like your typical controller.

    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #5850
    
    ## Solution
    
    - As described in the issue, added a `get_entity` method on `Commands` that returns an `Option<EntityCommands>`
    
    ## Changelog
    - Added the new method with a simple doc test
    - I have re-used `get_entity` in `entity`, similarly to how `get_single` is used in `single` while additionally preserving the error message
    - Add `#[inline]` to both functions
    
    Entities that have commands queued to despawn system will still return commands when `get_entity` is called but that is representative of the fact that the entity is still around until those commands are flushed.
    
    A potential `contains_entity` could also be added in this PR if desired, that would effectively be replacing Entities.contains but may be more discoverable if this is a common use case.

    Added the ability to get or set the last change tick of a system. (#5838)
    
    # Objective
    I'm build a UI system for bevy. In this UI system there is a concept of a system per UI entity. I had an issue where change detection wasn't working how I would expect and it's because when a function system is ran the `last_change_tick` is updated with the latest tick(from world). In my particular case I want to "wait" to update the `last_change_tick` until after my system runs for each entity.
    
    ## Solution
    Initially I thought bypassing the change detection all together would be a good fix, but on talking to some users in discord a simpler fix is to just expose `last_change_tick` to the end users. This is achieved by adding the following to the `System` trait:
    ```rust
        /// Allows users to get the system's last change tick.
        fn get_last_change_tick(&self) -> u32;
        /// Allows users to set the system's last change tick.
        fn set_last_change_tick(&mut self, last_change_tick: u32);
    ```
    
    This causes a bit of weirdness with two implementors of `System`. `FixedTimestep` and `ChainSystem` both implement system and thus it's required that some sort of implementation be given for the new functions. I solved this by outputting a warning and not doing anything for these systems.
    
    I think it's important to understand why I can't add the new functions only to the function system and not to the `System` trait. In my code I store the systems generically as `Box<dyn System<...>>`. I do this because I have differing parameters that are being passed in depending on the UI widget's system.  As far as I can tell there isn't a way to take a system trait and cast it into a specific type without knowing what those parameters are.
    
    In my own code this ends up looking something like:
    ```rust
    // Runs per entity.
    let old_tick = widget_system.get_last_change_tick();
    should_update_children = widget_system.run((widget_tree.clone(), entity.0), world);
    widget_system.set_last_change_tick(old_tick);
    
    
    // later on after all the entities have been processed:
    for system in context.systems.values_mut() {
        system.set_last_change_tick(world.read_change_tick());
    }
    ```
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added `get_last_change_tick` and `set_last_change_tick` to `System`'s.

    Add associated constant `IDENTITY` to `Transform` and friends. (#5340)
    
    # Objective
    Since `identity` is a const fn that takes no arguments it seems logical to make it an associated constant.
    This is also more in line with types from glam (eg. `Quat::IDENTITY`).
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The method `identity()` on `Transform`, `GlobalTransform` and `TransformBundle` has been deprecated.
    Use the associated constant `IDENTITY` instead.

    bevy_reflect: Get owned fields (#5728)
    
    # Objective
    
    Sometimes it's useful to be able to retrieve all the fields of a container type so that they may be processed separately. With reflection, however, we typically only have access to references.
    
    The only alternative is to "clone" the value using `Reflect::clone_value`. This, however, returns a Dynamic type in most cases. The solution there would be to use `FromReflect` instead, but this also has a problem in that it means we need to add `FromReflect` as an additional bound.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a `drain` method to all container traits. This returns a `Vec<Box<dyn Reflect>>` (except for `Map` which returns `Vec<(Box<dyn Reflect>, Box<dyn Reflect>)>`).
    
    This allows us to do things a lot simpler. For example, if we finished processing a struct and just need a particular value:
    
    ```rust
    // === OLD === //
    /// May or may not return a Dynamic*** value (even if `container` wasn't a `DynamicStruct`)
    fn get_output(container: Box<dyn Struct>, output_index: usize) -> Box<dyn Reflect> {
      container.field_at(output_index).unwrap().clone_value()
    }
    
    // === NEW === //
    /// Returns _exactly_ whatever was in the given struct
    fn get_output(container: Box<dyn Struct>, output_index: usize) -> Box<dyn Reflect> {
      container.drain().remove(output_index).unwrap()
    }
    ```
    
    ### Discussion
    
    * Is `drain` the best method name? It makes sense that it "drains" all the fields and that it consumes the container in the process, but I'm open to alternatives.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Added a `drain` method to the following traits:
      * `Struct`
      * `TupleStruct`
      * `Tuple`
      * `Array`
      * `List`
      * `Map`

    Add `pop` method for `List` trait. (#5797)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The reflection `List` trait does not have a `pop` function.
    - Popping elements off a list is a common use case and is almost always supported by `List`-like types.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add the `pop()` method to the `List` trait and add the appropriate implementations of this function.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Any custom type that implements the `List` trait will now need to implement the `pop` method.

    # Objective
    
    remove `insert_resource_with_id` because `insert_resource_by_id` exists and does almost exactly the same thing
    
    blocked on #5587 because otherwise we will leak a resource when it's inserted
    
    ## Solution
    
    remove the function and also add a safety invariant of to `insert_resource_by_id` that the id be valid for the world.
    
    I didn't see any discussion in #4447 about this safety invariant being left off in favor of a panic so I'm curious if there was one or if it just seemed nicer to have less safety invariants for callers to uphold :sweat_smile:
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - safety invariant added to `insert_resource_by_id` requiring the id to be valid for world
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - audit any calls to `insert_resource_by_id` making sure that the id is valid for the world

    Use 3 bits of PipelineKey to store MSAA sample count (#5826)
    
    Sample count always power of two. Thus, it is enough to store `log2(sample_count)`.
    This can be implemented using [u32::trailing_zeros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.u32.html#method.trailing_zeros). Then we can restore sample count with the `1 << stored`.
    You get 3 bits instead of 6 and up to 128x MSAA. This is more than is supported by any common hardware.
    
    Full table of possible variations:

    Add a module for common system `chain`/`pipe` adapters (#5776)
    
    # Objective
    
    Right now, users have to implement basic system adapters such as `Option` <-> `Result` conversions by themselves. This is slightly annoying and discourages the use of system chaining.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the module `system_adapter` to the prelude, which contains a collection of common adapters. This is very ergonomic in practice.
    
    ## Examples
    
    Convenient early returning.
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    
    App::new()
        // If the system fails, just try again next frame.
        .add_system(pet_dog.chain(system_adapter::ignore))
        .run();
    
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct Dog;
    
    fn pet_dog(dogs: Query<(&Name, Option<&Parent>), With<Dog>>) -> Option<()> {
        let (dog, dad) = dogs.iter().next()?;
        println!("You pet {dog}. He/she/they are a good boy/girl/pupper.");
        let (dad, _) = dogs.get(dad?.get()).ok()?;
        println!("Their dad's name is {dad}");
        Some(())
    }
    ```
    
    Converting the output of a system
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    
    App::new()
        .add_system(
            find_name
                .chain(system_adapter::new(String::from))
                .chain(spawn_with_name),
        )
        .run();
    
    fn find_name() -> &'static str { /* ... */ }
    fn spawn_with_name(In(name): In<String>, mut commands: Commands) {
        commands.spawn().insert(Name::new(name));
    }
    ```
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Added the module `bevy_ecs::prelude::system_adapter`, which contains a collection of common system chaining adapters.
      * `new` - Converts a regular fn to a system adapter.
      * `unwrap` - Similar to `Result::unwrap`
      * `ignore` - Discards the output of the previous system.

    Add UI scaling (#5814)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow users to change the scaling of the UI
    - Adopted from #2808
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This is an accessibility feature for fixed-size UI elements, allowing the developer to expose a range of UI scales for the player to set a scale that works for their needs.
    
    > - The user can modify the UiScale struct to change the scaling at runtime. This multiplies the Px values by the scale given, while not touching any others.
    > - The example showcases how this even allows for fluid transitions
    
    > Here's how the example looks like:

    ## Changelog
    
    - Added a `UiScale` which can be used to scale all of UI

    # Objective
    
    - `ansi_term` has become unmaintained: https://github.com/ogham/rust-ansi-term/issues/72
    - This is now blocking our CI so we need to find a way around that.

    bevy_reflect: Remove unnecessary `Clone` bounds (#5783)
    
    # Objective
    
    Some of the reflection impls for container types had unnecessary `Clone` bounds on their generic arguments. These come from before `FromReflect` when types were instead bound by `Reflect + Clone`. With `FromReflect` this is no longer necessary.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Removed all leftover `Clone` bounds from types that use `FromReflect` instead.
    
    ## Note
    
    I skipped `Result<T, E>`, `HashSet<T>`, and `Range<T>` since those do not use `FromReflect`. This should probably be handled in a separate PR since it would be a breaking change.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Remove unnecessary `Clone` bounds on reflected containers

    bevy_reflect: Fix `apply` method for `Option<T>` (#5780)
    
    # Objective
    
    #5658 made it so that `FromReflect` was used as the bound for `T` in `Option<T>`. However, it did not use this change effectively for the implementation of `Reflect::apply` (it was still using `take`, which would fail for Dynamic types).
    
    Additionally, the changes were not consistent with other methods within the file, such as the ones for `Vec<T>` and `HashMap<K, V>`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Update `Option<T>` to fallback on `FromReflect` if `take` fails, instead of wholly relying on one or the other.
    
    I also chose to update the error messages, as they weren't all too descriptive before.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Use `FromReflect::from_reflect` as a fallback in the `Reflect::apply` implementation for `Option<T>`

    Add missing type registrations for bevy_math types (#5758)
    
    Type registrations were only present for some of the `bevy_math` types, and missing for others. This is a very strange inconsistency, given that they all impl `Reflect` and `FromReflect`. In practice, this means these types cannot be used in scenes.
    
    In particular, this is especially problematic, because `Affine3A` is one of the missing types, and it is now used in `GlobalTransform`. Trying to create a bevy scene that contains `GlobalTransform`s results in an error due to the missing type registration.

    register missing reflect types (#5747)
    
    # Objective
    
    - While generating https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy_reflect_ts_type_export/blob/main/generated/types.ts, I noticed that some types that implement `Reflect` did not register themselves
    - `Viewport` isn't reflect but can be (there's a TODO)
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - register all reflected types
    - derive `Reflect` for `Viewport`
    
    
    ## Changelog
    - more types are not registered in the type registry
    - remove `Serialize`, `Deserialize` impls from `Viewport`
    
    
    I also decided to remove the `Serialize, Deserialize` from the `Viewport`, since they were (AFAIK) only used for reflection, which now is done without serde. So this is technically a breaking change for people who relied on that impl directly.
    Personally I don't think that every bevy type should implement `Serialize, Deserialize`, as that would lead to a ton of code generation that mostly isn't necessary because we can do the same with `Reflect`, but if this is deemed controversial I can remove it from this PR.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    - `KeyCode` now implements `Reflect` not as `reflect_value`, but with proper struct reflection. The `Serialize` and `Deserialize` impls were removed, now that they are no longer required for scene serialization.

    bevy_pbr: Fix tangent and normal normalization (#5666)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Morten Mikkelsen clarified that the world normal and tangent must be normalized in the vertex stage and the interpolated values must not be normalized in the fragment stage. This is in order to match the mikktspace approach exactly.
    - Fixes #5514 by ensuring the tangent basis matrix (TBN) is orthonormal
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Normalize the world normal in the vertex stage and not the fragment stage
    - Normalize the world tangent xyz in the vertex stage
    - Take into account the sign of the determinant of the local to world matrix when calculating the bitangent

    bevy_reflect: Add `FromReflect` to the prelude (#5720)
    
    # Objective
    
    `FromReflect` is a commonly used component to the Reflect API. It's required as a bound for reflecting things like `Vec<T>` and `HashMap<K, V>` and is generally useful (if not necessary) to derive on most structs or enums.
    
    Currently, however, it is not exported in `bevy_reflect`'s prelude. This means a module that uses `bevy_reflect` might have the following two lines:
    
    ```rust
    use bevy_reflect::prelude::*;
    use bevy_reflect::FromReflect;
    ```
    
    Additionally, users of the full engine might need to put:
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    use bevy::reflect::FromReflect;
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add `FromReflect` to the prelude of `bevy_reflect`.

    Correctly use as_hsla_f32 in Add<Color> and AddAssign<Color>, fixes #5543 (#5546)
    
    Probably a copy-paste error, but `Add<Color>` and `AddAssign<Color>` should use `rhs.as_hlsa_f32()` instead of `rhs.as_linear_rgba_f32()` when the LHS is a `Color::Hsla`. Fixes #5543.

    bevy_reflect: Relax bounds on `Option<T>` (#5658)
    
    # Objective
    
    The reflection impls on `Option<T>` have the bound `T: Reflect + Clone`. This means that using `FromReflect` requires `Clone` even though we can normally get away with just `FromReflect`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Update the bounds on `Option<T>` to match that of `Vec<T>`, where `T: FromReflect`.
    
    This helps remove a `Clone` implementation that may be undesired but added for the sole purpose of getting the code to compile.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Reflection on `Option<T>` now has `T` bound by `FromReflect` rather than `Reflect + Clone`
    * Added a `FromReflect` impl for `Instant`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If using `Option<T>` with Bevy's reflection API, `T` now needs to implement `FromReflect` rather than just `Clone`. This can be achieved easily by simply deriving `FromReflect`:
    
    ```rust
    
    // OLD
    #[derive(Reflect, Clone)]
    struct Foo;
    
    let reflected: Box<dyn Reflect> = Box::new(Some(Foo));
    
    // NEW
    #[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]
    struct Foo;
    
    let reflected: Box<dyn Reflect> = Box::new(Some(Foo));
    ```
    > Note: You can still derive `Clone`, but it's not required in order to compile.

    Remove an outdated workaround for `impl Trait` (#5659)
    
    # Objective
    
    Rust 1.63 resolved [an issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/83701) that prevents you from combining explicit generic arguments with `impl Trait` arguments.
    
    Now, we no longer need to use dynamic dispatch to work around this.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The methods `Schedule::get_stage` and `get_stage_mut` now accept `impl StageLabel` instead of `&dyn StageLabel`.
    
    ### Before
    ```rust
    let stage = schedule.get_stage_mut::<SystemStage>(&MyLabel)?;
    ```
    
    ### After
    ```rust
    let stage = schedule.get_stage_mut::<SystemStage>(MyLabel)?;
    ```

    - Replace the square with a circle in the breakout example.
    - Fixes #4324, adopted from #4682 by @shaderduck.
    
    ## Solution
    - Uses the Mesh2D APIs to draw a circle. The collision still uses the AABB algorithm, but it seems to be working fine, and I haven't seen any odd looking cases.

    Make vertex colors work without textures in bevy_sprite (#5685)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR changes it possible to use vertex colors without a texture using the bevy_sprite ColorMaterial.
    
    Fixes #5679
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Made multiplication of the output color independent of the COLOR_MATERIAL_FLAGS_TEXTURE_BIT bit
    - Extended mesh2d_vertex_color_texture example to show off both vertex colors and tinting
    
    Not sure if extending the existing example was the right call but it seems to be reasonable to me.
    
    I couldn't find any tests for the shaders and I think adding shader testing would be beyond the scope of this PR. So no tests in this PR. :grimacing:

    Some git blame later, I found out that commit ( https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/8eb0440f1ed0f075ed488e7efa36ba0f8bb37cad ) added already existing asserts while removing others.
    
    ## Solution

    - Always print the full message in the panic.
    
    ## Notes
    
    I originally had a separate error log because I wanted to make it clearer for users, but this is probably causing more issues than necessary.

    Remove `hashbrown` and `mio` from the skipped crates, according to `cargo deny check` this is no longer needed.

    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5668.
    
    The Rust version used in the CI `build` step previously depended on the default Rust version defined by GitHub in the Ubuntu image: <https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-Readme.md#rust-tools>
    
    This currently doesn't allow us to use Rust 1.63 features until this version is updated.
    
    ## Solution
    
    We now use the `actions-rs/toolchain@v1` action to always use the latest stable Rust version.
    This is already used for other CI jobs that we have.

    `ShaderData` is marked as public, but is an internal type only used by one other

    `ShaderData` is only used in `ShaderCache`, and the latter is private,

    it is.

    Make `Resource` trait opt-in, requiring `#[derive(Resource)]` V2 (#5577)
    
    *This PR description is an edited copy of #5007, written by @alice-i-cecile.*
    # Objective
    Follow-up to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2254. The `Resource` trait currently has a blanket implementation for all types that meet its bounds.
    
    While ergonomic, this results in several drawbacks:
    
    * it is possible to make confusing, silent mistakes such as inserting a function pointer (Foo) rather than a value (Foo::Bar) as a resource
    * it is challenging to discover if a type is intended to be used as a resource
    * we cannot later add customization options (see the [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/27-derive-component.md) for the equivalent choice for Component).
    * dependencies can use the same Rust type as a resource in invisibly conflicting ways
    * raw Rust types used as resources cannot preserve privacy appropriately, as anyone able to access that type can read and write to internal values
    * we cannot capture a definitive list of possible resources to display to users in an editor
    ## Notes to reviewers
     * Review this commit-by-commit; there's effectively no back-tracking and there's a lot of churn in some of these commits.
       *ira: My commits are not as well organized :')*
     * I've relaxed the bound on Local to Send + Sync + 'static: I don't think these concerns apply there, so this can keep things simple. Storing e.g. a u32 in a Local is fine, because there's a variable name attached explaining what it does.
     * I think this is a bad place for the Resource trait to live, but I've left it in place to make reviewing easier. IMO that's best tackled with https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4981.
    
    ## Changelog
    `Resource` is no longer automatically implemented for all matching types. Instead, use the new `#[derive(Resource)]` macro.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Add `#[derive(Resource)]` to all types you are using as a resource.
    
    If you are using a third party type as a resource, wrap it in a tuple struct to bypass orphan rules. Consider deriving `Deref` and `DerefMut` to improve ergonomics.
    
    `ClearColor` no longer implements `Component`. Using `ClearColor` as a component in 0.8 did nothing.
    Use the `ClearColorConfig` in the `Camera3d` and `Camera2d` components instead.

    Sync up bevy_sprite and bevy_ui shader View struct (#5531)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Similar to #5512 , the `View` struct definition in the shaders in `bevy_sprite` and `bevy_ui` were out of sync with the rust-side `ViewUniform`. Only `view_proj` was being used and is the first member and as those shaders are not customisable it makes little difference in practice, unlike for `Mesh2d`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Sync shader `View` struct definition in `bevy_sprite` and `bevy_ui` with the correct definition that matches `ViewUniform`

    Add `bevy_render::texture::ImageSettings` to prelude (#5566)
    
    # Objective
    
    In Bevy 0.8, the default filter mode was changed to linear (#4465). I believe this is a sensible default, but it's also very common to want to use point filtering (e.g. for pixel art games).
    
    ## Solution
    
    I am proposing including `bevy_render::texture::ImageSettings` in the Bevy prelude so it is more ergonomic to change the filtering in such cases.

    make `WorldQuery` very flat (#5205)
    
    # Objective
    
    Simplify the worldquery trait hierarchy as much as possible by putting it all in one trait. If/when gats are stabilised this can be trivially migrated over to use them, although that's not why I made this PR, those reasons are:
    - Moves all of the conceptually related unsafe code for a worldquery next to eachother
    - Removes now unnecessary traits simplifying the "type system magic" in bevy_ecs
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    All methods/functions/types/consts on `FetchState` and `Fetch` traits have been moved to the `WorldQuery` trait and the other traits removed. `WorldQueryGats` now only contains an `Item` and `Fetch` assoc type.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Implementors should move items in impls to the `WorldQuery/Gats` traits and remove any `Fetch`/`FetchState` impls
    Any use sites of items in the `Fetch`/`FetchState` traits should be updated to use the `WorldQuery` trait items instead

    fix order of exit/close window systems (#5558)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5384 and maybe other issues around window closing/app not exiting
    
    ## Solution
    
    There are three systems involved in exiting when closing a window:
    - `close_when_requested` asking Winit to close the window in stage `Update`
    - `exit_on_all_closed` exiting when no window remains opened in stage `Update`
    - `change_window` removing windows that are closed in stage `PostUpdate`
    
    This ordering meant that when closing a window, we had to run one more frame to actually exit. As there was no window, panics could occur in systems assuming there was a window. In case of Bevy app using a low power options, that means waiting for the timeout before actually exiting the app (60 seconds by default)
    
    This PR changes the ordering so that `exit_on_all_closed` happens after `change_window` in the same frame, so there isn't an extra frame without window

    bevy_reflect: Update enum derives (#5473)
    
    > In draft until #4761 is merged. See the relevant commits [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5473/commits/a85fe94a183fdd62d512b2613376ce6eace8ab63).
    
    ---
    
    # Objective
    
    Update enums across Bevy to use the new enum reflection and get rid of `#[reflect_value(...)]` usages.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Find and replace all[^1] instances of `#[reflect_value(...)]` on enum types.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Updated all[^1] reflected enums to implement `Enum` (i.e. they are no longer `ReflectRef::Value`)
    
    ## Migration Guide
    Bevy-defined enums have been updated to implement `Enum` and are not considered value types (`ReflectRef::Value`) anymore. This means that their serialized representations will need to be updated. For example, given the Bevy enum:
    
    ```rust
    pub enum ScalingMode {
      None,
      WindowSize,
      Auto { min_width: f32, min_height: f32 },
      FixedVertical(f32),
      FixedHorizontal(f32),
    }
    ```
    
    You will need to update the serialized versions accordingly.
    
    ```js
    // OLD FORMAT
    {
      "type": "bevy_render::camera::projection::ScalingMode",
      "value": FixedHorizontal(720),
    },
    
    // NEW FORMAT
    {
      "type": "bevy_render::camera::projection::ScalingMode",
      "enum": {
        "variant": "FixedHorizontal",
        "tuple": [
          {
            "type": "f32",
            "value": 720,
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    ```
    
    This may also have other smaller implications (such as `Debug` representation), but serialization is probably the most prominent.

    bevy_reflect: Reflect enums (#4761)
    
    # Objective
    
    > This is a revival of #1347. Credit for the original PR should go to @Davier.
    
    Currently, enums are treated as `ReflectRef::Value` types by `bevy_reflect`. Obviously, there needs to be better a better representation for enums using the reflection API.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Based on prior work from @Davier, an `Enum` trait has been added as well as the ability to automatically implement it via the `Reflect` derive macro. This allows enums to be expressed dynamically:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    enum Foo {
      A,
      B(usize),
      C { value: f32 },
    }
    
    let mut foo = Foo::B(123);
    assert_eq!("B", foo.variant_name());
    assert_eq!(1, foo.field_len());
    
    let new_value = DynamicEnum::from(Foo::C { value: 1.23 });
    foo.apply(&new_value);
    assert_eq!(Foo::C{value: 1.23}, foo);
    ```
    
    ### Features
    
    #### Derive Macro
    
    Use the `#[derive(Reflect)]` macro to automatically implement the `Enum` trait for enum definitions. Optionally, you can use `#[reflect(ignore)]` with both variants and variant fields, just like you can with structs. These ignored items will not be considered as part of the reflection and cannot be accessed via reflection.
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    enum TestEnum {
      A,
      // Uncomment to ignore all of `B`
      // #[reflect(ignore)]
      B(usize),
      C {
        // Uncomment to ignore only field `foo` of `C`
        // #[reflect(ignore)]
        foo: f32,
        bar: bool,
      },
    }
    ```
    
    #### Dynamic Enums
    
    Enums may be created/represented dynamically via the `DynamicEnum` struct. The main purpose of this struct is to allow enums to be deserialized into a partial state and to allow dynamic patching. In order to ensure conversion from a `DynamicEnum` to a concrete enum type goes smoothly, be sure to add `FromReflect` to your derive macro.
    
    ```rust
    let mut value = TestEnum::A;
    
    // Create from a concrete instance
    let dyn_enum = DynamicEnum::from(TestEnum::B(123));
    
    value.apply(&dyn_enum);
    assert_eq!(TestEnum::B(123), value);
    
    // Create a purely dynamic instance
    let dyn_enum = DynamicEnum::new("TestEnum", "A", ());
    
    value.apply(&dyn_enum);
    assert_eq!(TestEnum::A, value);
    ```
    
    #### Variants
    
    An enum value is always represented as one of its variants— never the enum in its entirety.
    
    ```rust
    let value = TestEnum::A;
    assert_eq!("A", value.variant_name());
    
    // Since we are using the `A` variant, we cannot also be the `B` variant
    assert_ne!("B", value.variant_name());
    ```
    
    All variant types are representable within the `Enum` trait: unit, struct, and tuple.
    
    You can get the current type like:
    
    ```rust
    match value.variant_type() {
      VariantType::Unit => println!("A unit variant!"),
      VariantType::Struct => println!("A struct variant!"),
      VariantType::Tuple => println!("A tuple variant!"),
    }
    ```
    
    > Notice that they don't contain any values representing the fields. These are purely tags.
    
    If a variant has them, you can access the fields as well:
    
    ```rust
    let mut value = TestEnum::C {
      foo: 1.23,
      bar: false
    };
    
    // Read/write specific fields
    *value.field_mut("bar").unwrap() = true;
    
    // Iterate over the entire collection of fields
    for field in value.iter_fields() {
      println!("{} = {:?}", field.name(), field.value());
    }
    ```
    
    #### Variant Swapping
    
    It might seem odd to group all variant types under a single trait (why allow `iter_fields` on a unit variant?), but the reason this was done ~~is to easily allow *variant swapping*.~~ As I was recently drafting up the **Design Decisions** section, I discovered that other solutions could have been made to work with variant swapping. So while there are reasons to keep the all-in-one approach, variant swapping is _not_ one of them.
    
    ```rust
    let mut value: Box<dyn Enum> = Box::new(TestEnum::A);
    value.set(Box::new(TestEnum::B(123))).unwrap();
    ```
    
    #### Serialization
    
    Enums can be serialized and deserialized via reflection without needing to implement `Serialize` or `Deserialize` themselves (which can save thousands of lines of generated code). Below are the ways an enum can be serialized.
    
    > Note, like the rest of reflection-based serialization, the order of the keys in these representations is important!
    
    ##### Unit
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "my_crate::TestEnum",
      "enum": {
        "variant": "A"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ##### Tuple
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "my_crate::TestEnum",
      "enum": {
        "variant": "B",
        "tuple": [
          {
            "type": "usize",
            "value": 123
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    <details>
    <summary>Effects on Option</summary>
    
    This ends up making `Option` look a little ugly:
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "core::option::Option<usize>",
      "enum": {
        "variant": "Some",
        "tuple": [
          {
            "type": "usize",
            "value": 123
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    
    </details>
    
    ##### Struct
    
    ```json
    {
      "type": "my_crate::TestEnum",
      "enum": {
        "variant": "C",
        "struct": {
          "foo": {
            "type": "f32",
            "value": 1.23
          },
          "bar": {
            "type": "bool",
            "value": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Design Decisions
    
    <details>
    <summary><strong>View Section</strong></summary>
    
    This section is here to provide some context for why certain decisions were made for this PR, alternatives that could have been used instead, and what could be improved upon in the future.
    
    ### Variant Representation
    
    One of the biggest decisions was to decide on how to represent variants. The current design uses a "all-in-one" design where unit, tuple, and struct variants are all simultaneously represented by the `Enum` trait. This is not the only way it could have been done, though.
    
    #### Alternatives
    
    ##### 1. Variant Traits
    
    One way of representing variants would be to define traits for each variant, implementing them whenever an enum featured at least one instance of them. This would allow us to define variants like:
    
    ```rust
    pub trait Enum: Reflect {
      fn variant(&self) -> Variant;
    }
    
    pub enum Variant<'a> {
        Unit,
        Tuple(&'a dyn TupleVariant),
        Struct(&'a dyn StructVariant),
    }
    
    pub trait TupleVariant {
      fn field_len(&self) -> usize;
      // ...
    }
    ```
    
    And then do things like:
    
    ```rust
    fn get_tuple_len(foo: &dyn Enum) -> usize {
      match foo.variant() {
        Variant::Tuple(tuple) => tuple.field_len(),
        _ => panic!("not a tuple variant!")
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The reason this PR does not go with this approach is because of the fact that variants are not separate types. In other words, we cannot implement traits on specific variants— these cover the *entire* enum. This means we offer an easy footgun:
    
    ```rust
    let foo: Option<i32> = None;
    let my_enum = Box::new(foo) as Box<dyn TupleVariant>;
    ```
    
    Here, `my_enum` contains `foo`, which is a unit variant. However, since we need to implement `TupleVariant` for `Option` as a whole, it's possible to perform such a cast. This is obviously wrong, but could easily go unnoticed. So unfortunately, this makes it not a good candidate for representing variants.
    
    ##### 2. Variant Structs
    
    To get around the issue of traits necessarily needing to apply to both the enum and its variants, we could instead use structs that are created on a per-variant basis. This was also considered but was ultimately [[removed](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4761/commits/71d27ab3c6871bb188d8b46512db3b0922a56a0c)](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4761/commits/71d27ab3c6871bb188d8b46512db3b0922a56a0c) due to concerns about allocations.
    
     Each variant struct would probably look something like:
    
    ```rust
    pub trait Enum: Reflect {
      fn variant_mut(&self) -> VariantMut;
    }
    
    pub enum VariantMut<'a> {
        Unit,
        Tuple(TupleVariantMut),
        Struct(StructVariantMut),
    }
    
    struct StructVariantMut<'a> {
      fields: Vec<&'a mut dyn Reflect>,
      field_indices: HashMap<Cow<'static, str>, usize>
    }
    ```
    
    This allows us to isolate struct variants into their own defined struct and define methods specifically for their use. It also prevents users from casting to it since it's not a trait. However, this is not an optimal solution. Both `field_indices` and `fields` will require an allocation (remember, a `Box<[T]>` still requires a `Vec<T>` in order to be constructed). This *might* be a problem if called frequently enough.
    
    ##### 3. Generated Structs
    
    The original design, implemented by @Davier, instead generates structs specific for each variant. So if we had a variant path like `Foo::Bar`, we'd generate a struct named `FooBarWrapper`. This would be newtyped around the original enum and forward tuple or struct methods to the enum with the chosen variant.
    
    Because it involved using the `Tuple` and `Struct` traits (which are also both bound on `Reflect`), this meant a bit more code had to be generated. For a single struct variant with one field, the generated code amounted to ~110LoC. However, each new field added to that variant only added ~6 more LoC.
    
    In order to work properly, the enum had to be transmuted to the generated struct:
    
    ```rust
    fn variant(&self) -> crate::EnumVariant<'_> {
      match self {
        Foo::Bar {value: i32} => {
          let wrapper_ref = unsafe {
            std::mem::transmute::<&Self, &FooBarWrapper>(self)
          };
          crate::EnumVariant::Struct(wrapper_ref as &dyn crate::Struct)
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This works because `FooBarWrapper` is defined as `repr(transparent)`.
    
    Out of all the alternatives, this would probably be the one most likely to be used again in the future. The reasons for why this PR did not continue to use it was because:
    
    * To reduce generated code (which would hopefully speed up compile times)
    * To avoid cluttering the code with generated structs not visible to the user
    * To keep bevy_reflect simple and extensible (these generated structs act as proxies and might not play well with current or future systems)
    * To avoid additional unsafe blocks
    * My own misunderstanding of @Davier's code
    
    That last point is obviously on me. I misjudged the code to be too unsafe and unable to handle variant swapping (which it probably could) when I was rebasing it. Looking over it again when writing up this whole section, I see that it was actually a pretty clever way of handling variant representation.
    
    #### Benefits of All-in-One
    
    As stated before, the current implementation uses an all-in-one approach. All variants are capable of containing fields as far as `Enum` is concerned. This provides a few benefits that the alternatives do not (reduced indirection, safer code, etc.).
    
    The biggest benefit, though, is direct field access. Rather than forcing users to have to go through pattern matching, we grant direct access to the fields contained by the current variant. The reason we can do this is because all of the pattern matching happens internally. Getting the field at index `2` will automatically return `Some(...)` for the current variant if it has a field at that index or `None` if it doesn't (or can't).
    
    This could be useful for scenarios where the variant has already been verified or just set/swapped (or even where the type of variant doesn't matter):
    
    ```rust
    let dyn_enum: &mut dyn Enum = &mut Foo::Bar {value: 123};
    // We know it's the `Bar` variant
    let field = dyn_enum.field("value").unwrap();
    ```
    
    Reflection is not a type-safe abstraction— almost every return value is wrapped in `Option<...>`. There are plenty of places to check and recheck that a value is what Reflect says it is. Forcing users to have to go through `match` each time they want to access a field might just be an extra step among dozens of other verification processes.
    
     Some might disagree, but ultimately, my view is that the benefit here is an improvement to the ergonomics and usability of reflected enums.
    
    </details>

    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    * Added `Enum` trait
    * Added `Enum` impl to `Reflect` derive macro
    * Added `DynamicEnum` struct
      * Added `DynamicVariant`
    * Added `EnumInfo`
      * Added `VariantInfo`
        * Added `StructVariantInfo`
        * Added `TupleVariantInfo`
        * Added `UnitVariantInfo`
    * Added serializtion/deserialization support for enums
      * Added `EnumSerializer`
    
    * Added `VariantType`
    * Added `VariantFieldIter`
    * Added `VariantField`
    * Added `enum_partial_eq(...)`
    * Added `enum_hash(...)`
    
    ### Changed
    
    * `Option<T>` now implements `Enum`
    * `bevy_window` now depends on `bevy_reflect`
      * Implemented `Reflect` and `FromReflect` for `WindowId`
    * Derive `FromReflect` on `PerspectiveProjection`
    * Derive `FromReflect` on `OrthographicProjection`
    * Derive `FromReflect` on `WindowOrigin`
    * Derive `FromReflect` on `ScalingMode`
    * Derive `FromReflect` on `DepthCalculation`
    
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    * Enums no longer need to be treated as values and usages of `#[reflect_value(...)]` can be removed or replaced by `#[reflect(...)]`
    * Enums (including `Option<T>`) now take a different format when serializing. The format is described above, but this may cause issues for existing scenes that make use of enums.

    Add `FromWorld` bound to `T` in `Local<T>` (#5481)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, actually using a `Local` on a system requires that it be `T: FromWorld`, but that requirement is only expressed on the `SystemParam` machinery, which leads to the confusing error message for when the user attempts to add an invalid system. By adding these bounds to `Local` directly, it improves clarity on usage and semantics.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `T: FromWorld` bound to `Local`'s definition
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - It might be possible for references to `Local`s without `T: FromWorld` to exist, but these should be exceedingly rare and probably dead code. In the event that one of these is encountered, the easiest solutions are to delete the code or wrap the inner `T` in an `Option` to allow it to be default constructed to `None`.

    # Objective
    
    - Migrate changes from #3503.
    
    ## Solution

    - Update tests for `Size`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed

    ## Migration Guide

    Support array / cubemap / cubemap array textures in KTX2  (#5325)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fix / support KTX2 array / cubemap / cubemap array textures
    - Fixes #4495 . Supersedes #4514 .
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `Option<TextureViewDescriptor>` to `Image` to enable configuration of the `TextureViewDimension` of a texture.
      - This allows users to set `D2Array`, `D3`, `Cube`, `CubeArray` or whatever they need
      - Automatically configure this when loading KTX2
    - Transcode all layers and faces instead of just one
    - Use the UASTC block size of 128 bits, and the number of blocks in x/y for a given mip level in order to determine the offset of the layer and face within the KTX2 mip level data
    - `wgpu` wants data ordered as layer 0 mip 0..n, layer 1 mip 0..n, etc. See https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/util/trait.DeviceExt.html#tymethod.create_texture_with_data
    - Reorder the data KTX2 mip X layer Y face Z to `wgpu` layer Y face Z mip X order
    - Add a `skybox` example to demonstrate / test loading cubemaps from PNG and KTX2, including ASTC 4x4, BC7, and ETC2 compression for support everywhere. Note that you need to enable the `ktx2,zstd` features to be able to load the compressed textures.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Fixed: KTX2 array / cubemap / cubemap array textures
    - Fixes: Validation failure for compressed textures stored in KTX2 where the width/height are not a multiple of the block dimensions.
    - Added: `Image` now has an `Option<TextureViewDescriptor>` field to enable configuration of the texture view. This is useful for configuring the `TextureViewDimension` when it is not just a plain 2D texture and the loader could/did not identify what it should be.

    Replace `many_for_each_mut` with `iter_many_mut`. (#5402)
    
    # Objective
    Replace `many_for_each_mut` with `iter_many_mut` using the same tricks to avoid aliased mutability that `iter_combinations_mut` uses.
    
    <sub>I tried rebasing the draft PR I made for this before and it died. F</sub>
    ## Why
    `many_for_each_mut` is worse for a few reasons:
    1. The closure prevents the use of `continue`, `break`, and `return` behaves like a limited `continue`.
    2. rustfmt will crumple it and double the indentation when the line gets too long.
        ```rust
        query.many_for_each_mut(
            &entity_list,
            |(mut transform, velocity, mut component_c)| {
                // Double trouble.
            },
        );
        ```
    3. It is more surprising to have `many_for_each_mut` as a mutable counterpart to `iter_many` than `iter_many_mut`.
    4. It required a separate unsafe fn; more unsafe code to maintain.
    5. The `iter_many_mut` API matches the existing `iter_combinations_mut` API.

    add a debug label to storage buffers (#5341)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Expose the wgpu debug label on storage buffer types.
    
    ## Solution
    
    🐄
    
    - Add an optional cow static string and pass that to the label field of create_buffer_with_data
    - This pattern is already used by Bevy for debug tags on bind group and layout descriptors.
    
    ---
    
    Example Usage:
    
    A buffer is given a label using the label function. Alternatively a buffer may be labeled when it is created if the default() convention is not used.

    Here is the buffer appearing with the correct name in RenderDoc. Previously the buffer would have an anonymous name such as "Buffer223":

    text rendering: convert colours only once per section (#5474)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Improve performance when rendering text
    
    ## Solution
    
    - While playing with example `many_buttons`, I noticed a lot of time was spent converting colours
    - Investigating, the biggest culprit seems to be text colour. Each glyph in a text is an individual UI node for rendering, with a copy of the colour. Making the conversion to RGBA linear only once per text section reduces the number of conversion done once rendering.
    - This improves FPS for example `many_buttons` from ~33 to ~42
    - I did the same change for text 2d

    Conversion of `ResMut` and `NonSendMut` to `Mut` (#5438)
    
    # Objective
    
    Enable treating components and resources equally, which can
    simplify the implementation of some systems where only the change
    detection feature is relevant and not the kind of object (resource or
    component).
    
    ## Solution
    
    Implement `From<ResMut<T>>` and `From<NonSendMut<T>>` for
    `Mut`. Since the 3 structs are similar, and only differ by their system
    param role, the conversion is trivial.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Added - `From<ResMut>` and `From<NonSendMut>` for `Mut<T>`.

    remove blanket `Serialize + Deserialize` requirement for `Reflect` on generic types (#5197)
    
    # Objective
    
    Some generic types like `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>` and `HashMap<K, V>` implement `Reflect` when where their generic types `T`/`K`/`V` implement `Serialize + for<'de> Deserialize<'de>`.
    This is so that in their `GetTypeRegistration` impl they can insert the `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` type data structs.
    
    This has the annoying side effect that if your struct contains a `Option<NonSerdeStruct>` you won't be able to derive reflect (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4054).
    
    ## Solution
    
    - remove the `Serialize + Deserialize` bounds on wrapper types
      - this means that `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` will no longer be inserted even for `.register::<Option<DoesImplSerde>>()`
    - add `register_type_data<T, D>` shorthand for `registry.get_mut(T).insert(D::from_type<T>())`
    - require users to register their specific generic types **and the serde types** separately like
    ```rust
            .register_type::<Option<String>>()
            .register_type_data::<Option<String>, ReflectSerialize>()
            .register_type_data::<Option<String>, ReflectDeserialize>()
    
    ```
    I believe this is the best we can do for extensibility and convenience without specialization.
    
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `.register_type` for generic types like `Option<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `HashMap<K, V>` will no longer insert `ReflectSerialize` and `ReflectDeserialize` type data. Instead you need to register it separately for concrete generic types like so:
    ```rust
            .register_type::<Option<String>>()
            .register_type_data::<Option<String>, ReflectSerialize>()
            .register_type_data::<Option<String>, ReflectDeserialize>()
    ```
    
    TODO: more docs and tweaks to the scene example to demonstrate registering generic types.

    dds: Ensure the Extent3d for compressed textures represents the physical size (#5406)
    
    # Objective
    
    - wgpu 0.13 has validation to ensure that the width and height specified for a texture are both multiples of the respective block width and block height. This means validation fails for compressed textures with say a 4x4 block size, but non-modulo-4 image width/height.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Using `Extent3d`'s `physical_size()` method in the `dds` loader. It takes a `TextureFormat` argument and ensures the resolution is correct.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Fixes: Validation failure for compressed textures stored in `dds` where the width/height are not a multiple of the block dimensions.

    Disable UI node `Interaction` when `ComputedVisibility` is false (#5361)
    
    # Objective
    
    UI nodes can be hidden by setting their `Visibility` property. Since #5310 was merged, this is now ergonomic to use, as visibility is now inherited.
    
    However, UI nodes still receive (and store) interactions when hidden, resulting in surprising hidden state (and an inability to otherwise disable UI nodes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Fixes #5360.
    
    I've updated the `ui_focus_system` to accomplish this in a minimally intrusive way, and updated the docs to match.
    
    **NOTE:** I have not added automated tests to verify this behavior, as we do not currently have a good testing paradigm for `bevy_ui`. I'm not thrilled with that by any means, but I'm not sure fixing it is within scope.
    
    ## Paths not taken
    
    ### Separate `Disabled` component
    
    This is a much larger and more controversial change, and not well-scoped to UI.
    Furthermore, it is extremely rare that you want hidden UI elements to function: the most common cases are for things like changing tabs, collapsing elements or so on.
    Splitting this behavior would be more complex, and substantially violate user expectations.
    
    ### A separate limbo world
    
    Mentioned in the linked issue. Super cool, but all of the problems  of the `Disabled` component solution with a whole new RFC-worth of complexity.
    
    ### Using change detection to reduce the amount of redundant work
    
    Adds a lot of complexity for questionable performance gains. Likely involves a complete refactor of the entire system.
    
    We simply don't have the tests or benchmarks here to justify this.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - UI nodes are now always in an `Interaction::None` state while they are hidden (via the `ComputedVisibility` component).

    don't cull ui nodes that have a rotation (#5389)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #5293
    - UI nodes with a rotation that made the top left corner lower than the top right corner (z rotations greater than π/4) were culled
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Do not cull nodes with a rotation, but don't do proper culling in this case
    
    
    
    As a reminder, changing rotation and scale of UI nodes is not recommended as it won't impact layout. This is a quick fix but doesn't handle properly rotations and scale in clipping/culling. This would need a lot more work as mentioned here: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c2b332f98a0bcab7390e4b184099202cfb4fbbe1/crates/bevy_ui/src/render/mod.rs#L404-L405

    # Objective
    
    I noticed while working on #5366 that the documentation for label types wasn't working correctly. Having experimented with this for a few weeks, I believe that generating docs in macros is more effort than it's worth.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add more boilerplate, copy-paste and edit the docs across types. This also lets us add custom doctests for specific types. Also, we don't need `concat_idents` as a dependency anymore.

    Improve ergonomics and reduce boilerplate around creating text elements. (#5343)
    
    # Objective
    
    Creating UI elements is very boilerplate-y with lots of indentation.
    This PR aims to reduce boilerplate around creating text elements.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Renamed `Text::with_section` to `from_section`.
      It no longer takes a `TextAlignment` as argument, as the vast majority of cases left it `Default::default()`.
    * Added `Text::from_sections` which creates a `Text` from a list of `TextSections`.
      Reduces line-count and reduces indentation by one level.
    * Added `Text::with_alignment`.
      A builder style method for setting the `TextAlignment` of a `Text`.
    * Added `TextSection::new`.
      Does not reduce line count, but reduces character count and made it easier to read. No more `.to_string()` calls!
    * Added `TextSection::from_style` which creates an empty `TextSection` with a style.
      No more empty strings! Reduces indentation.
    * Added `TextAlignment::CENTER` and friends.
    * Added methods to `TextBundle`. `from_section`, `from_sections`, `with_text_alignment` and `with_style`.
    
    ## Note for reviewers.
    Because of the nature of these changes I recommend setting diff view to 'split'.
    ~~Look for the book icon~~ cog in the top-left of the Files changed tab.
    
    Have fun reviewing :heart:
    <sup> >:D </sup>
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `Text::with_section` was renamed to `from_section` and no longer takes a `TextAlignment` as argument.
    Use `with_alignment` to set the alignment instead.

    Recalculate entity aabbs when meshes change (#4944)
    
    # Objective
    
    Update the `calculate_bounds` system to update `Aabb`s
    for entities who've either:
    - gotten a new mesh
    - had their mesh mutated
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4294.
    
    ## Solution
    
    There are two commits here to address the two issues above:
    
    ### Commit 1
    
    **This Commit**
    Updates the `calculate_bounds` system to operate not only on entities
    without `Aabb`s but also on entities whose `Handle<Mesh>` has changed.
    
    **Why?**
    So if an entity gets a new mesh, its associated `Aabb` is properly
    recalculated.
    
    **Questions**
    - This type is getting pretty gnarly - should I extract some types?
    - This system is public - should I add some quick docs while I'm here?
    
    ### Commit 2
    
    **This Commit**
    Updates `calculate_bounds` to update `Aabb`s of entities whose meshes
    have been directly mutated.
    
    **Why?**
    So if an entity's mesh gets updated, its associated `Aabb` is properly
    recalculated.
    
    **Questions**
    - I think we should be using `ahash`. Do we want to do that with a
      direct `hashbrown` dependency or an `ahash` dependency that we
      configure the `HashMap` with?
    - There is an edge case of duplicates with `Vec<Entity>` in the
      `HashMap`. If an entity gets its mesh handle changed and changed back
      again it'll be added to the list twice. Do we want to use a `HashSet`
      to avoid that? Or do a check in the list first (assuming iterating
      over the `Vec` is faster and this edge case is rare)?
    - There is an edge case where, if an entity gets a new mesh handle and
      then its old mesh is updated, we'll update the entity's `Aabb` to the
      new geometry of the _old_ mesh. Do we want to remove items from the
      `Local<HashMap>` when handles change? Does the `Changed` event give us
      the old mesh handle? If not we might need to have a
      `HashMap<Entity, Handle<Mesh>>` or something so we can unlink entities
      from mesh handles when the handle changes.
    - I did the `zip()` with the two `HashMap` gets assuming those would
      be faster than calculating the Aabb of the mesh (otherwise we could do
      `meshes.get(mesh_handle).and_then(Mesh::compute_aabb).zip(entity_mesh_map...)`
      or something). Is that assumption way off?
    
    ## Testing
    
    I originally tried testing this with `bevy_mod_raycast` as mentioned in the
    original issue but it seemed to work (maybe they are currently manually
    updating the Aabbs?). I then tried doing it in 2D but it looks like
    `Handle<Mesh>` is just for 3D. So I took [this example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/3d/pbr.rs)
    and added some systems to mutate/assign meshes:

    Allows conversion of mutable queries to immutable queries (#5376)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allows conversion of mutable queries to immutable queries.
    - Fixes #4606
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `to_readonly` method on `Query`, which uses `QueryState::as_readonly`
    - `AsRef` is not feasible because creation of new queries is needed.

    bevy_reflect: `ReflectFromPtr` to create `&dyn Reflect` from a `*const ()` (#4475)
    
    # Objective
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4447 adds functions that can fetch resources/components as `*const ()` ptr by providing the `ComponentId`. This alone is not enough for them to be usable safely with reflection, because there is no general way to go from the raw pointer to a `&dyn Reflect` which is the pointer + a pointer to the VTable of the `Reflect` impl.
    
    By adding a `ReflectFromPtr` type that is included in the type type registration when deriving `Reflect`, safe functions can be implemented in scripting languages that don't assume a type layout and can access the component data via reflection:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct StringResource {
        value: String
    }
    ```
    
    ```lua
    local res_id = world:resource_id_by_name("example::StringResource")
    local res = world:resource(res_id)
    
    print(res.value)
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. add a `ReflectFromPtr` type with a `FromType<T: Reflect>` implementation and the following methods:
    - `     pub unsafe fn as_reflect_ptr<'a>(&self, val: Ptr<'a>) -> &'a dyn Reflect`
    - `     pub unsafe fn as_reflect_ptr_mut<'a>(&self, val: PtrMut<'a>) -> &'a mud dyn Reflect`
    
    Safety requirements of the methods are that you need to check that the `ReflectFromPtr` was constructed for the correct type.
    
    2. add that type to the `TypeRegistration` in the `GetTypeRegistration` impl generated by `#[derive(Reflect)]`.
    This is different to other reflected traits because it doesn't need `#[reflect(ReflectReflectFromPtr)]` which IMO should be there by default.

    Derive AsBindGroup Improvements: Better errors, more options, update examples (#5364)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Provide better compile-time errors and diagnostics.
    - Add more options to allow more textures types and sampler types.
    - Update array_texture example to use upgraded AsBindGroup derive macro.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Split out the parsing of the inner struct/field attributes (the inside part of a `#[foo(...)]` attribute) for better clarity
    
    Parse the binding index for all inner attributes, as it is part of all attributes (`#[foo(0, ...)`), then allow each attribute implementer to parse the rest of the attribute metadata as needed. This should make it very trivial to extend/change if needed in the future.
    
    Replaced invocations of `panic!` with the `syn::Error` type, providing fine-grained errors that retains span information. This provides much nicer compile-time errors, and even better IDE errors.

    Updated the array_texture example to demonstrate the new changes.
    
    ## New AsBindGroup attribute options
    
    
    ### `#[texture(u32, ...)]`
    Where `...` is an optional list of arguments.
    | Arguments     | Values                                                                | Default |
    |-------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------       | ----------- |
    | dimension = "..."     | `"1d"`, `"2d"`, `"2d_array"`, `"3d"`, `"cube"`, `"cube_array"`        |    `"2d"`    |
    | sample_type = "..."   | `"float"`, `"depth"`, `"s_int"` or `"u_int"`                          |    `"float"`    |
    | filterable = ...      | `true`, `false`                                                       |    `true`     |
    | multisampled = ...    | `true`, `false`                                                       |    `false` |
    | visibility(...)       | `all`, `none`, or a list-combination of `vertex`, `fragment`, `compute` |   `vertex`, `fragment`   |
    
    Example: `#[texture(0, dimension = "2d_array", visibility(vertex, fragment))]`
    
    
    ### `#[sampler(u32, ...)]`
    Where `...` is an optional list of arguments.
    | Arguments     | Values                                                | Default |
    |-----------    |---------------------------------------------------    | ----------- |
    | sampler_type = "..."          | `"filtering"`, `"non_filtering"`, `"comparison"`.     |  `"filtering"`  |
    | visibility(...)       | `all`, `none`, or a list-combination of `vertex`, `fragment`, `compute` |   `vertex`, `fragment`   |
    
    Example: `#[sampler(0, sampler_type = "filtering", visibility(vertex, fragment)]`
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added more options to `#[texture(...)]` and `#[sampler(...)]` attributes, supporting more kinds of materials. See above for details.
    - Upgraded IDE and compile-time error messages.
    - Updated array_texture example using the new options.

    Add helpers to send `Events` from `World` (#5355)
    
    # Objective
    
    - With access to `World`, it's not obvious how to send an event.
    - This is especially useful if you are writing a `Command` that needs to send an `Event`.
    - `Events` are a first-class construct in bevy, even though they are just `Resources` under the hood. Their methods should be discoverable.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Provide a simple helpers to send events through `Res<Events<T>>`.

    Add attribute to ignore fields of derived labels (#5366)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #5362
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the attribute `#[label(ignore_fields)]` for `*Label` types.
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(SystemLabel)]
    pub enum MyLabel {
        One,
    
        // Previously this was not allowed since labels cannot contain data.
        #[system_label(ignore_fields)]
        Two(PhantomData<usize>),
    }
    ```
    
    ## Notes
    
    This label makes it possible for equality to behave differently depending on whether or not you are treating the type as a label. For example:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(SystemLabel, PartialEq, Eq)]
    #[system_label(ignore_fields)]
    pub struct Foo(usize);
    ```
    
    If you compare it as a label, it will ignore the wrapped fields as the user requested. But if you compare it as a `Foo`, the derive will incorrectly compare the inner fields. I see a few solutions
    
    1. Do nothing. This is technically intended behavior, but I think we should do our best to prevent footguns.
    2. Generate impls of `PartialEq` and `Eq` along with the `#[derive(Label)]` macros. This is a breaking change as it requires all users to remove these derives from their types.
    3. Only allow `PhantomData` to be used with `ignore_fields` -- seems needlessly prescriptive.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Added the `ignore_fields` attribute to the derive macros for `*Label` types.
    * Added an example showing off different forms of the derive macro.

    remove QF generics from all `Query/State` methods and types (#5170)
    
    # Objective
    
    remove `QF` generics from a bunch of types and methods on query related items. this has a few benefits:
    - simplifies type signatures `fn iter(&self) -> QueryIter<'_, 's, Q::ReadOnly, F::ReadOnly>` is (imo) conceptually simpler than `fn iter(&self) -> QueryIter<'_, 's, Q, ROQueryFetch<'_, Q>, F>`
    - `Fetch` is mostly an implementation detail but previously we had to expose it on every `iter` `get` etc method
    - Allows us to potentially in the future simplify the `WorldQuery` trait hierarchy by removing the `Fetch` trait
    
    ## Solution
    
    remove the `QF` generic and add a way to (unsafely) turn `&QueryState<Q1, F1>` into `&QueryState<Q2, F2>`
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog/Migration Guide
    
    The `QF` generic was removed from various `Query` iterator types and some methods, you should update your code to use the type of the corresponding worldquery of the fetch type that was being used, or call `as_readonly`/`as_nop` to convert a querystate to the appropriate type. For example:
    `.get_single_unchecked_manual::<ROQueryFetch<Q>>(..)` -> `.as_readonly().get_single_unchecked_manual(..)`
    `my_field: QueryIter<'w, 's, Q, ROQueryFetch<'w, Q>, F>` -> `my_field: QueryIter<'w, 's, Q::ReadOnly, F::ReadOnly>`

    Use Affine3A for GlobalTransform to allow any affine transformation (#4379)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add capability to use `Affine3A`s for some `GlobalTransform`s. This allows affine transformations that are not possible using a single `Transform` such as shear and non-uniform scaling along an arbitrary axis.
    - Related to #1755 and #2026
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `GlobalTransform` becomes an enum wrapping either a `Transform` or an `Affine3A`.
    - The API of `GlobalTransform` is minimized to avoid inefficiency, and to make it clear that operations should be performed using the underlying data types.
    - using `GlobalTransform::Affine3A` disables transform propagation, because the main use is for cases that `Transform`s cannot support.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `GlobalTransform`s can optionally support any affine transformation using an `Affine3A`.

    The changes in #5053 makes it possible to add custom materials with a lot less boiler plate. However, the implementation isn't shared with Material 2d as it's a kind of fork of the bevy_pbr version. It should be possible to use AsBindGroup on the 2d version as well.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This makes the same kind of changes in Material2d in bevy_sprite.
    
    This makes the following work:
    
    ```rust
    //! Draws a circular purple bevy in the middle of the screen using a custom shader
    
    use bevy::{
        prelude::*,
        reflect::TypeUuid,
        render::render_resource::{AsBindGroup, ShaderRef},
        sprite::{Material2d, Material2dPlugin, MaterialMesh2dBundle},
    };
    
    fn main() {
        App::new()
            .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
            .add_plugin(Material2dPlugin::<CustomMaterial>::default())
            .add_startup_system(setup)
            .run();
    }
    
    /// set up a simple 2D scene
    fn setup(
        mut commands: Commands,
        mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
        mut materials: ResMut<Assets<CustomMaterial>>,
        asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,
    ) {
        commands.spawn_bundle(MaterialMesh2dBundle {
            mesh: meshes.add(shape::Circle::new(50.).into()).into(),
            material: materials.add(CustomMaterial {
                color: Color::PURPLE,
                color_texture: Some(asset_server.load("branding/icon.png")),
            }),
            transform: Transform::from_translation(Vec3::new(-100., 0., 0.)),
            ..default()
        });
    
        commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle::default());
    }
    
    /// The Material2d trait is very configurable, but comes with sensible defaults for all methods.
    /// You only need to implement functions for features that need non-default behavior. See the Material api docs for details!
    impl Material2d for CustomMaterial {
        fn fragment_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "shaders/custom_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    }
    
    // This is the struct that will be passed to your shader
    #[derive(AsBindGroup, TypeUuid, Debug, Clone)]

    pub struct CustomMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        #[texture(1)]
        #[sampler(2)]
        color_texture: Option<Handle<Image>>,
    }
    ```

    Visibilty Inheritance, universal ComputedVisibility and RenderLayers support (#5310)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #4907. Fixes #838. Fixes #5089.
    Supersedes #5146. Supersedes #2087. Supersedes #865. Supersedes #5114
    
    Visibility is currently entirely local. Set a parent entity to be invisible, and the children are still visible. This makes it hard for users to hide entire hierarchies of entities.
    
    Additionally, the semantics of `Visibility` vs `ComputedVisibility` are inconsistent across entity types. 3D meshes use `ComputedVisibility` as the "definitive" visibility component, with `Visibility` being just one data source. Sprites just use `Visibility`, which means they can't feed off of `ComputedVisibility` data, such as culling information, RenderLayers, and (added in this pr) visibility inheritance information.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Splits `ComputedVisibilty::is_visible` into `ComputedVisibilty::is_visible_in_view` and `ComputedVisibilty::is_visible_in_hierarchy`. For each visible entity, `is_visible_in_hierarchy` is computed by propagating visibility down the hierarchy. The `ComputedVisibility::is_visible()` function combines these two booleans for the canonical "is this entity visible" function.
    
    Additionally, all entities that have `Visibility` now also have `ComputedVisibility`.  Sprites, Lights, and UI entities now use `ComputedVisibility` when appropriate.
    
    This means that in addition to visibility inheritance, everything using Visibility now also supports RenderLayers. Notably, Sprites (and other 2d objects) now support `RenderLayers` and work properly across multiple views.
    
    Also note that this does increase the amount of work done per sprite. Bevymark with 100,000 sprites on `main` runs in `0.017612` seconds and this runs in `0.01902`. That is certainly a gap, but I believe the api consistency and extra functionality this buys us is worth it. See [this thread](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5146#issuecomment-1182783452) for more info. Note that #5146 in combination with #5114 _are_ a viable alternative to this PR and _would_ perform better, but that comes at the cost of api inconsistencies and doing visibility calculations in the "wrong" place. The current visibility system does have potential for performance improvements. I would prefer to evolve that one system as a whole rather than doing custom hacks / different behaviors for each feature slice.
    
    Here is a "split screen" example where the left camera uses RenderLayers to filter out the blue sprite.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2694663/178814868-2e9a2173-bf8c-4c79-8815-633899d492c3.png)
    
    
    Note that this builds directly on #5146 and that @james7132 deserves the credit for the baseline visibility inheritance work. This pr moves the inherited visibility field into `ComputedVisibility`, then does the additional work of porting everything to `ComputedVisibility`. See my [comments here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5146#issuecomment-1182783452) for rationale.
    
    ## Follow up work
    
    * Now that lights use ComputedVisibility, VisibleEntities now includes "visible lights" in the entity list. Functionally not a problem as we use queries to filter the list down in the desired context. But we should consider splitting this out into a separate`VisibleLights` collection for both clarity and performance reasons. And _maybe_ even consider scoping `VisibleEntities` down to `VisibleMeshes`?.
    * Investigate alternative sprite rendering impls (in combination with visibility system tweaks) that avoid re-generating a per-view fixedbitset of visible entities every frame, then checking each ExtractedEntity. This is where most of the performance overhead lives. Ex: we could generate ExtractedEntities per-view using the VisibleEntities list, avoiding the need for the bitset.
    * Should ComputedVisibility use bitflags under the hood? This would cut down on the size of the component, potentially speed up the `is_visible()` function, and allow us to cheaply expand ComputedVisibility with more data (ex: split out local visibility and parent visibility, add more culling classes, etc).
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * ComputedVisibility now takes hierarchy visibility into account.
    * 2D, UI and Light entities now use the ComputedVisibility component.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If you were previously reading `Visibility::is_visible` as the "actual visibility" for sprites or lights, use `ComputedVisibilty::is_visible()` instead:
    
    ```rust
    // before (0.7)
    fn system(query: Query<&Visibility>) {
      for visibility in query.iter() {
        if visibility.is_visible {
           log!("found visible entity");
        }
      }
    }
    
    // after (0.8)
    fn system(query: Query<&ComputedVisibility>) {
      for visibility in query.iter() {
        if visibility.is_visible() {
           log!("found visible entity");
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Parameterize nightly toolchain in CI (#5330)
    
    # Objective
    
    Rust's nightly builds semi-regularly break us (or our dependencies). This creates churn and angst when we're just trying to get our jobs done.
    
    We do still want nightly builds for a variety of reasons:
    
    * cargo-udeps requires nightly and likely always will.
    * Helps us catch rust nightly bugs quickly. We're "good citizens" if we regularly report regressions.
    * Lets us prepare for "actual expected breakage" ahead of stable releases so we avoid breaking main users.
    
    ## Solution
    
    * This pr parameterizes the nightly toolchain, making it an easy one-liner to pin our builds to a specific nightly, when required.
    * Put nightly jobs to check wasm and nightly on their own matrix. I also removed tests on nightly linux, just build check
    * alternative to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5329

    # Objective

    ## Solution
    
    - Add an example using a simple `Material` and `Mesh` definition to draw a 3d line
            - Shows how to use `LineList` and `LineStrip` in combination with a specialized `Material`
    
    ## Notes
    
    This isn't just a primitive shape because it needs a special Material, but I think it's a good showcase of the power of the `Material` and `AsBindGroup` abstractions. All of this is easy to figure out when you know these options are a thing, but I think they are hard to discover which is why I think this should be an example and not shipped with bevy.

    Simplify design for `*Label`s (#4957)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Closes #4954
    - Reduce the complexity of the `{System, App, *}Label` APIs.
    
    ## Solution
    
    For the sake of brevity I will only refer to `SystemLabel`, but everything applies to all of the other label types as well.
    
    - Add `SystemLabelId`, a lightweight, `copy` struct.
    - Convert custom types into `SystemLabelId` using the trait `SystemLabel`.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - String literals implement `SystemLabel` for now, but this should be changed with #4409 .
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Any previous use of `Box<dyn SystemLabel>` should be replaced with `SystemLabelId`.
    - `AsSystemLabel` trait has been modified.
        - No more output generics.
        - Method `as_system_label` now returns `SystemLabelId`, removing an unnecessary level of indirection.
    - If you *need* a label that is determined at runtime, you can use `Box::leak`. Not recommended.
    
    ## Questions for later
    
    * Should we generate a `Debug` impl along with `#[derive(*Label)]`?
    * Should we rename `as_str()`?
    * Should we remove the extra derives (such as `Hash`) from builtin `*Label` types?
    * Should we automatically derive types like `Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq`?
    * More-ergonomic comparisons between `Label` and `LabelId`.
    * Move `Dyn{Eq, Hash,Clone}` somewhere else.
    * Some API to make interning dynamic labels easier.
    * Optimize string representation
        * Empty string for unit structs -- no debug info but faster comparisons
        * Don't show enum types -- same tradeoffs as asbove.

    Fix incorrect rotation in `Transform::rotate_around`. (#5300)
    
    Someone noted that the `rotate_around` method did not give the results they expected: [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/996497295325544479)
    I tested `rotate_around` and their workaround and it seems like it was indeed incorrect.
    
    Here is a scene with some cubes at different angles all being rotated around the center on the Y axis.
    
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29694403/178598432-407d7e80-1caf-4b17-b69b-66d9156c81e1.mp4
    
    Interestingly, the middle cube rotates as you might expect. This threw me for a bit of a loop before I added the other cubes to the test haha.
    
    Here is the same scene with the order multiplication of the quaternions flipped in `rotate_around`.
    
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29694403/178598446-a98026f3-524c-448b-8437-4d0d3175c6ca.mp4
    
    That looks better :)
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Fixed `rotate_around` rotating the wrong way around
    * Added `translate_around`. - Split out the translation code from `rotate_around`.
    * Simplified/optimized `rotate_local_*` methods. - Yep, That works somehow.
    
    <sup>Quaternions sure are wacky. Do not ask me how this works exactly, haha.</sup>

    Instead of using a simple utility function for loading, which uses a default allocation limit of 512MB, we use a Reader object which can be configured ad hoc.

    Alias world_to_viewport for easier migration (#5298)
    
    # Objective
    
    When someone searches in rustdoc for `world_to_screen`, they now will
    find `world_to_viewport`. The method was renamed in 0.8, it would be
    nice to allow users to find the new name more easily.

    docs: Full documentation for bevy_asset (#3536)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR aims to document the `bevy_asset` crate to complete coverage, while also trying to improve some bits of UX.
    
    ### Progress
    
    - [x] Root items
    - [x] `handle` module
    - [x] `info` module
    - [x] `path` module
    - [x] `loader` module
    - [x] `io` and `filesystem_watcher` module
    - [x] `assets` module
    - [x] `asset_server` module
    - [x] `diagnostic` module
    - [x] `debug_asset_server` module
    - [x] Crate level documentation
    - [x] Add `#![warn(missing_docs)]` lint
    
    Coverage: 100%
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Rename `FileAssetIo::get_root_path` uses to `FileAssetIo::get_base_path`
    
        `FileAssetIo::root_path()` is a getter for the `root_path` field, while `FileAssetIo::get_root_path` returned the parent directory of the asset root path, which was the executable's directory unless `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` was set. This change solves the ambiguity between the two methods.

    Update time by sending frame instant through a channel (#4744)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The time update is currently done in the wrong part of the schedule. For a single frame the current order of things is update input, update time (First stage), other stages, render stage (frame presentation). So when we update the time it includes the input processing of the current frame and the frame presentation of the previous frame. This is a problem when vsync is on. When input processing takes a longer amount of time for a frame, the vsync wait time gets shorter. So when these are not paired correctly we can potentially have a long input processing time added to the normal vsync wait time in the previous frame. This leads to inaccurate frame time reporting and more variance of the time than actually exists. For more details of why this is an issue see the linked issue below.
    - Helps with https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4669
    - Supercedes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4728 and https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4735. This PR should be less controversial than those because it doesn't add to the API surface.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - The most accurate frame time would come from hardware. We currently don't have access to that for multiple reasons, so the next best thing we can do is measure the frame time as close to frame presentation as possible. This PR gets the Instant::now() for the time immediately after frame presentation in the render system and then sends that time to the app world through a channel.
    - implements suggestion from @aevyrie from here https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4728#discussion_r872010606

    ## Changelog

    ## Migration Guide

    Update codebase to use `IntoIterator` where possible. (#5269)
    
    Remove unnecessary calls to `iter()`/`iter_mut()`.
    Mainly updates the use of queries in our code, docs, and examples.
    
    ```rust
    // From
    for _ in list.iter() {
    for _ in list.iter_mut() {
    
    // To
    for _ in &list {
    for _ in &mut list {
    ```
    
    We already enable the pedantic lint [clippy::explicit_iter_loop](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/stable/) inside of Bevy. However, this only warns for a few known types from the standard library.
    
    ## Note for reviewers
    As you can see the additions and deletions are exactly equal.
    Maybe give it a quick skim to check I didn't sneak in a crypto miner, but you don't have to torture yourself by reading every line.
    I already experienced enough pain making this PR :)

    Validate vertex attribute format on insert (#5259)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Validate the format of the values with the expected attribute format.
    - Currently, if you pass the wrong format, it will crash somewhere unrelated with a very cryptic error message, so it's really hard to debug for beginners.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Compare the format and panic when unexpected format is passed
    
    ## Note
    
    - I used a separate `error!()` for a human friendly message because the panic message is very noisy and hard to parse for beginners. I don't mind changing this to only a panic if people prefer that.
    - This could potentially be something that runs only in debug mode, but I don't think inserting attributes is done often enough for this to be an issue.

    Improve Gamepad DPad Button Detection (#5220)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Enable the `axis_dpad_to_button` gilrs filter to map hats to dpad buttons on supported remotes.
    - Fixes https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing-input-manager/issues/149
    - Might have fixed the confusion related to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3229
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Enables the `axis_dpad_to_button` filter in `gilrs` which will use it's remote mapping information to see if there are hats mapped to dpads for that remote model. I don't really understand the logic it uses exactly, but it is usually enabled by default in gilrs and I believe it probably leads to more intuitive mapping compared to the current situation of dpad buttons being mapped to an axis.
    - Removes the `GamepadAxisType::DPadX` and `GamepadAxisType::DPadY` enum variants to avoid user confusion. Those variants should never be emitted anyway, for all supported remotes.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog

    ## Migration Guide
    
    If your game reads gamepad events or queries the axis state of `GamePadAxisType::DPadX` or `GamePadAxisType::DPadY`, then you must migrate your code to check whether or not the `GamepadButtonType::DPadUp`, `GamepadButtonType::DPadDown`, etc. buttons were pressed instead.

    Hierarchy commandization (#4197)
    
    ## Objective
    Implement absolute minimum viable product for the changes proposed in bevyengine/rfcs#53.
    
    ## Solution
    
     - Remove public mutative access to `Parent` (Children is already publicly read-only). This includes public construction methods like `Copy`, `Clone`, and `Default`.
     - Remove `PreviousParent`
     - Remove `parent_update_system`
     - Update all hierarchy related commands to immediately update both `Parent` and `Children` references.
    
    ## Remaining TODOs
    
     - [ ] Update documentation for both `Parent` and `Children`. Discourage using `EntityCommands::remove`
     - [x] Add `HierarchyEvent` to notify listeners of hierarchy updates. This is meant to replace listening on `PreviousParent`
    
    ## Followup
    
     - These changes should be best moved to the hooks mentioned in #3742.
     - Backing storage for both might be best moved to indexes mentioned in the same relations.

    Make `RenderStage::Extract` run on the render world (#4402)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Currently, the `Extract` `RenderStage` is executed on the main world, with the render world available as a resource.
    - However, when needing access to resources in the render world (e.g. to mutate them), the only way to do so was to get exclusive access to the whole `RenderWorld` resource.
    - This meant that effectively only one extract which wrote to resources could run at a time.
    - We didn't previously make `Extract`ing writing to the world a non-happy path, even though we want to discourage that.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Move the extract stage to run on the render world.
    - Add the main world as a `MainWorld` resource.
    - Add an `Extract` `SystemParam` as a convenience to access a (read only) `SystemParam` in the main world during `Extract`.
    
    ## Future work
    
    It should be possible to avoid needing to use `get_or_spawn` for the render commands, since now the `Commands`' `Entities` matches up with the world being executed on.
    We need to determine how this interacts with https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3519
    It's theoretically possible to remove the need for the `value` method on `Extract`. However, that requires slightly changing the `SystemParam` interface, which would make it more complicated. That would probably mess up the `SystemState` api too.
    
    ## Todo
    I still need to add doc comments to `Extract`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    - The `Extract` `RenderStage` now runs on the render world (instead of the main world as before).
       You must use the `Extract` `SystemParam` to access the main world during the extract phase.
       Resources on the render world can now be accessed using `ResMut` during extract.
    
    ### Removed
    - `Commands::spawn_and_forget`. Use `Commands::get_or_spawn(e).insert_bundle(bundle)` instead
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    The `Extract` `RenderStage` now runs on the render world (instead of the main world as before).
    You must use the `Extract` `SystemParam` to access the main world during the extract phase. `Extract` takes a single type parameter, which is any system parameter (such as `Res`, `Query` etc.). It will extract this from the main world, and returns the result of this extraction when `value` is called on it.
    
    For example, if previously your extract system looked like:
    ```rust
    fn extract_clouds(mut commands: Commands, clouds: Query<Entity, With<Cloud>>) {
        for cloud in clouds.iter() {
            commands.get_or_spawn(cloud).insert(Cloud);
        }
    }
    ```
    the new version would be:
    ```rust
    fn extract_clouds(mut commands: Commands, mut clouds: Extract<Query<Entity, With<Cloud>>>) {
        for cloud in clouds.value().iter() {
            commands.get_or_spawn(cloud).insert(Cloud);
        }
    }
    ```
    The diff is:
    ```diff
    --- a/src/clouds.rs
    +++ b/src/clouds.rs
    @@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
    -fn extract_clouds(mut commands: Commands, clouds: Query<Entity, With<Cloud>>) {
    -    for cloud in clouds.iter() {
    +fn extract_clouds(mut commands: Commands, mut clouds: Extract<Query<Entity, With<Cloud>>>) {
    +    for cloud in clouds.value().iter() {
             commands.get_or_spawn(cloud).insert(Cloud);
         }
     }
    ```
    You can now also access resources from the render world using the normal system parameters during `Extract`:
    ```rust
    fn extract_assets(mut render_assets: ResMut<MyAssets>, source_assets: Extract<Res<MyAssets>>) {
         *render_assets = source_assets.clone();
    }
    ```
    Please note that all existing extract systems need to be updated to match this new style; even if they currently compile they will not run as expected. A warning will be emitted on a best-effort basis if this is not met.

    # Objective
    
    Support removing attributes from meshes. For an example use case, meshes created using the bevy::predule::shape types or loaded from external files may have attributes that are not needed for the materials they will be rendered with.

    Allow rendering meshes without UV coordinate data. (#5222)
    
    # Objective
    
    Bevy requires meshes to include UV coordinates, even if the material does not use any textures, and will fail with an error `ERROR bevy_pbr::material: Mesh is missing requested attribute: Vertex_Uv (MeshVertexAttributeId(2), pipeline type: Some("bevy_pbr::material::MaterialPipeline<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial>"))` otherwise. The objective of this PR is to permit this.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR follows the design of #4528, which added support for per-vertex colours. It adds a shader define called VERTEX_UVS which indicates the presence of UV coordinates to the shader.

    Spotlights (#4715)
    
    # Objective
    
    add spotlight support
    
    ## Solution / Changelog
    
    - add spotlight angles (inner, outer) to ``PointLight`` struct. emitted light is linearly attenuated from 100% to 0% as angle tends from inner to outer. Direction is taken from the existing transform rotation.
    - add spotlight direction (vec3) and angles (f32,f32) to ``GpuPointLight`` struct (60 bytes -> 80 bytes) in ``pbr/render/lights.rs`` and ``mesh_view_bind_group.wgsl``
    - reduce no-buffer-support max point light count to 204 due to above
    - use spotlight data to attenuate light in ``pbr.wgsl``
    - do additional cluster culling on spotlights to minimise cost in ``assign_lights_to_clusters``
    - changed one of the lights in the lighting demo to a spotlight
    - also added a ``spotlight`` demo - probably not justified but so reviewers can see it more easily
    
    ## notes
    
    increasing the size of the GpuPointLight struct on my machine reduces the FPS of ``many_lights -- sphere`` from ~150fps to 140fps.
    
    i thought this was a reasonable tradeoff, and felt better than handling spotlights separately which is possible but would mean introducing a new bind group, refactoring light-assignment code and adding new spotlight-specific code in pbr.wgsl. the FPS impact for smaller numbers of lights should be very small.
    
    the cluster culling strategy reintroduces the cluster aabb code which was recently removed... sorry. the aabb is used to get a cluster bounding sphere, which can then be tested fairly efficiently using the strategy described at the end of https://bartwronski.com/2017/04/13/cull-that-cone/. this works well with roughly cubic clusters (where the cluster z size is close to the same as x/y size), less well for other cases like single Z slice / tiled forward rendering. In the worst case we will end up just keeping the culling of the equivalent point light.

    Adds a "Question" link to the new issue selection (#5169)
    
    This gives users a hint to use the GitHub "Discussions" for questions about bevy, instead of filing an issue.
    
    ## Objective
    > Users sometimes file unhelpful issues when asking questions about how to use Bevy.
    
    We should provide a link to the Discussion board in the list of "new Issue" options. This hopefully allows users to better find this option and reduces the number of question-issues.

    Move the configuration of the WindowPlugin to a resource (#5227)
    
    # Objective
    
    It is currently hard to configure the `WindowPlugin`, as it is added as part of the `DefaultPlugins`. Ideally this should not be difficult.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Remove the configuration from the plugin itself and put it as a `Resource`, similar to how it is done for almost all other plugins.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    If you are currently configuring the behavior of the `WindowPlugin`, by constructing it manually, then you will need to instead create add the `WindowSettings` as a resource.

    # Objective
    
    Add texture sampling to the GLSL shader example, as naga does not support the commonly used sampler2d type.
    Fixes #5059
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Align the shader_material_glsl example behaviour with the shader_material example,  as the later includes texture sampling.
    - Update the GLSL shader to do texture sampling the way naga supports it, and document the way naga does not support it.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - The shader_material_glsl example has been updated to demonstrate texture sampling using the GLSL shading language.

    Rename CameraUi (#5234)
    
    # Objective
    
    In bevy 0.7, `CameraUi` was a component specifically added to cameras
    that display the UI. Since camera-driven rendering was merged, it
    actually does the opposite! This will make it difficult for current
    users to adapt to 0.8.
    
    ## Solution
    
    To avoid unnecessary confusion, we rename `CameraUi` into
    `UiCameraConfig`.

    implement reflection for more glam types (#5194)
    
    # Objective
    
    - To implement `Reflect` for more glam types.
    
    ## Solution
    
    insert `impl_reflect_struct` invocations for more glam types. I am not sure about the boolean vectors, since none of them implement `Serde::Serialize/Deserialize`, and the SIMD versions don't have public fields.
    I do still think implementing reflection is useful for BVec's since then they can be incorporated into `Reflect`'ed components and set dynamically even if as a whole + it's more consistent.
    
    ## Changelog
    Implemented `Reflect` for the following types
     - BVec2
     - BVec3
     - **BVec3A** (on simd supported platforms only)
     - BVec4
     - **BVec4A** (on simd supported platforms only)

    Add ViewRangefinder3d to reduce boilerplate when enqueuing standard 3D PhaseItems. (#5014)
    
    # Objective
    
    Reduce the boilerplate code needed to make draw order sorting work correctly when queuing items through new common functionality. Also fix several instances in the bevy code-base (mostly examples) where this boilerplate appears to be incorrect.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Moved the logic for handling back-to-front vs front-to-back draw ordering into the PhaseItems by inverting the sort key ordering of Opaque3d and AlphaMask3d. The means that all the standard 3d rendering phases measure distance in the same way. Clients of these structs no longer need to know to negate the distance.
    - Added a new utility struct, ViewRangefinder3d, which encapsulates the maths needed to calculate a "distance" from an ExtractedView and a mesh's transform matrix.
    - Converted all the occurrences of the distance calculations in Bevy and its examples to use ViewRangefinder3d. Several of these occurrences appear to be buggy because they don't invert the view matrix or don't negate the distance where appropriate. This leads me to the view that Bevy should expose a facility to correctly perform this calculation.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Code which creates Opaque3d, AlphaMask3d, or Transparent3d phase items _should_ use ViewRangefinder3d to calculate the distance value.
    
    Code which manually calculated the distance for Opaque3d or AlphaMask3d phase items and correctly negated the z value will no longer depth sort correctly. However, incorrect depth sorting for these types will not impact the rendered output as sorting is only a performance optimisation when drawing with depth-testing enabled. Code which manually calculated the distance for Transparent3d phase items will continue to work as before.

    add more `SAFETY` comments and lint for missing ones in `bevy_ecs` (#4835)
    
    # Objective
    
    `SAFETY` comments are meant to be placed before `unsafe` blocks and should contain the reasoning of why in this case the usage of unsafe is okay. This is useful when reading the code because it makes it clear which assumptions are required for safety, and makes it easier to spot possible unsoundness holes. It also forces the code writer to think of something to write and maybe look at the safety contracts of any called unsafe methods again to double-check their correct usage.
    
    There's a clippy lint called `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` which warns when using a block without such a comment.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - since clippy expects `SAFETY` instead of `SAFE`, rename those
    - add `SAFETY` comments in more places
    - for the last remaining 3 places, add an `#[allow()]` and `// TODO` since I wasn't comfortable enough with the code to justify their safety
    - add ` #![warn(clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks)]` to `bevy_ecs`
    
    
    ### Note for reviewers
    
    The first commit only renames `SAFETY` to `SAFE` so it doesn't need a thorough review.

    bevy_reflect: remove `glam` from a test which is active without the glam feature (#5195)

    `glam` is an optional feature in `bevy_reflect` and there is a separate `mod test { #[cfg(feature = "glam")] mod glam { .. }}`.
    The `reflect_downcast` test is not in that module and doesn't depend on glam, which breaks `cargo test -p bevy_reflect` without the `glam` feature.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the glam types from the test, they're not relevant to it

    bevy_reflect: support map insertion  (#5173)
    
    # Objective
    
    This is a rebase of #3701 which is currently scheduled for 0.8 but is marked for adoption.
    
    > Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/3609
    
    ## Solution
    > - add an `insert_boxed()` method on the `Map` trait
    > - implement it for `HashMap` using a new `FromReflect` generic bound
    > - add a `map_apply()` helper method to implement `Map::apply()`, that inserts new values instead of ignoring them

    Remove the dependency cycles (#5171)
    
    # Objective
    
    - I think our codebase is hit badly by rust-lang/rust-analyzer#11410
    - None of our uses of cyclic dependencies are remotely necessary
    - Note that these are false positives in rust-analyzer, however it's probably easier for us to work around this
    - Note also that I haven't confirmed that this is causing rust-analyzer to not work very well, but it's not a bad guess.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove our cyclic dependencies
    - Import the trick from #2851 for no-op plugin groups.

    Add Events to `bevy_ecs` prelude (#5159)
    
    # Objective
    
    This is a common and useful type. I frequently use this when working with `Events` resource directly, typically when caching the data or manipulating the `World` directly.
    
    This is also useful when manually configuring the cleanup strategy for events.

    Add `inverse_projection` and `inverse_view_proj` fields to shader view uniform (#5119)
    
    # Objective
    
    Transform screen-space coordinates into world space in shaders. (My use case is for generating rays for ray tracing with the same perspective as the 3d camera).

    Add `inverse_projection` and `inverse_view_proj` fields to shader view uniform

    ### Added

    ## Note
    
    It'd probably be good to double-check that I did the matrix multiplication in the right order for `inverse_proj_view`. Thanks!

    Add TextureAtlas stress test based on many_sprites and sprite_sheet examples (#5087)
    
    # Objective
    
    Intended to close #5073
    
    ## Solution
    
    Adds a stress test that use TextureAtlas based on the existing many_sprites test using the animated sprite implementation from the sprite_sheet example.
    
    In order to satisfy the goals described in #5073 the animations are all slightly offset.
    
    Of note is that the original stress test was designed to test fullstrum culling. I kept this test similar as to facilitate easy comparisons between the use of TextureAtlas and without.

    Add option to center a window (#4999)
    
    # Objective
    - Fixes #4993
    
    ## Solution
    
    - ~~Add `centered` property to `WindowDescriptor`~~
    - Add `WindowPosition` enum
    - `WindowDescriptor.position` is now `WindowPosition` instead of `Option<Vec2>`
    - Add `center_window` function to `Window`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    - If using `WindowDescriptor`, replace `position: None` with `position: WindowPosition::Default` and `position: Some(vec2)`  with `WindowPosition::At(vec2)`.
    
    I'm not sure if this is the best approach, so feel free to give any feedback.
    Also I'm not sure how `Option`s should be handled in `bevy_winit/src/lib.rs:161`.
    
    Also, on window creation we can't (or at least I couldn't) get `outer_size`, so this doesn't include decorations in calculations.

    Rework extract_meshes (#4240)
    
    * Cleanup redundant code
    * Use a type alias to make sure the `caster_query` and
      `not_caster_query` really do the same thing and access the same things
    
    **Objective**
    
    Cleanup code that would otherwise be difficult to understand
    
    **Solution**
    
    * `extract_meshes` had two for loops which are functionally identical,
      just copy-pasted code. I extracted the common code between the two
      and put them into an anonymous function.
    * I flattened the tuple literal for the bundle batch, it looks much
      less nested and the code is much more readable as a result.
    * The parameters of `extract_meshes` were also very daunting, but they
      turned out to be the same query repeated twice. I extracted the query
      into a type alias.
    
    EDIT: I reworked the PR to **not do anything breaking**, and keep the old allocation behavior. Removing the memorized length was clearly a performance loss, so I kept it.

    Enable wgpu profiling spans when using bevy's trace feature (#5182)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Enable `wgpu` profiling spans
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `wgpu` uses the `profiling` crate to add profiling span instrumentation to their code
    - `profiling` offers multiple 'backends' for profiling, including `tracing`
    - When the `bevy` `trace` feature is used, add the `profiling` crate with its `profile-with-tracing` feature to enable appropriate profiling spans in `wgpu` using `tracing` which fits nicely into our infrastructure
    - Bump our default `tracing` subscriber filter to `wgpu=info` from `wgpu=error` so that the profiling spans are not filtered out as they are created at the `info` level.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added: `tracing` profiling support for `wgpu` when using bevy's `trace` feature
    - Changed: The default `tracing` filter statement for `wgpu` has been changed from the `error` level to the `info` level to not filter out the wgpu profiling spans

    Disable Vsync for stress tests. (#5187)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently stress tests are vsynced. This is undesirable for a stress test, as you want to run them with uncapped framerates.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Ensure all stress tests are using PresentMode::Immediate if they render anything.

    Fixes #5112
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `encase` needs to update to `glam` as well. See teoxoy/encase#4 on progress on that.
    - `hexasphere` also needs to be updated, see OptimisticPeach/hexasphere#12.

    Move `get_short_name` utility method from `bevy_reflect` into `bevy_utils` (#5174)
    
    # Summary
    
    This method strips a long type name like `bevy::render::camera::PerspectiveCameraBundle` down into the bare type name (`PerspectiveCameraBundle`). This is generally useful utility method, needed by #4299 and #5121.
    
    As a result:
    
    - This method was moved to `bevy_utils` for easier reuse.
    - The legibility and robustness of this method has been significantly improved.
    - Harder test cases have been added.
    
    This change was split out of #4299 to unblock it and make merging / reviewing the rest of those changes easier.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - added `bevy_utils::get_short_name`, which strips the path from a type name for convenient display.
    - removed the `TypeRegistry::get_short_name` method. Use the function in `bevy_utils` instead.

    fix some memory leaks detected by miri (#4959)
    
    The first leak:
    ```rust
        #[test]
        fn blob_vec_drop_empty_capacity() {
            let item_layout = Layout::new::<Foo>();
            let drop = drop_ptr::<Foo>;
            let _ = unsafe { BlobVec::new(item_layout, Some(drop), 0) };
        }
    ```
    this is because we allocate the swap scratch in blobvec regardless of what the capacity is, but we only deallocate if capacity is > 0
    
    The second leak:
    ```rust
        #[test]
        fn panic_while_overwriting_component() {
            let helper = DropTestHelper::new();
    
            let res = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
                let mut world = World::new();
                world
                    .spawn()
                    .insert(helper.make_component(true, 0))
                    .insert(helper.make_component(false, 1));
    
                println!("Done inserting! Dropping world...");
            });
    
            let drop_log = helper.finish(res);
    
            assert_eq!(
                &*drop_log,
                [
                    DropLogItem::Create(0),
                    DropLogItem::Create(1),
                    DropLogItem::Drop(0),
                ]
            );
        }
    ```
    this is caused by us not running the drop impl on the to-be-inserted component if the drop impl of the overwritten component panics
    
    ---
    
    managed to figure out where the leaks were by using this 10/10 command
    ```
    cargo --quiet test --lib -- --list | sed 's/: test$//' | MIRIFLAGS="-Zmiri-disable-isolation" xargs -n1 cargo miri test --lib -- --exact
    ```
    which runs every test one by one rather than all at once which let miri actually tell me which test had the leak :upside_down_face:

    Better Materials: AsBindGroup trait and derive, simpler Material trait (#5053)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR reworks Bevy's Material system, making the user experience of defining Materials _much_ nicer. Bevy's previous material system leaves a lot to be desired:
    * Materials require manually implementing the `RenderAsset` trait, which involves manually generating the bind group, handling gpu buffer data transfer, looking up image textures, etc. Even the simplest single-texture material involves writing ~80 unnecessary lines of code. This was never the long term plan.
    * There are two material traits, which is confusing, hard to document, and often redundant: `Material` and `SpecializedMaterial`. `Material` implicitly implements `SpecializedMaterial`, and `SpecializedMaterial` is used in most high level apis to support both use cases. Most users shouldn't need to think about specialization at all (I consider it a "power-user tool"), so the fact that `SpecializedMaterial` is front-and-center in our apis is a miss.
    * Implementing either material trait involves a lot of "type soup". The "prepared asset" parameter is particularly heinous: `&<Self as RenderAsset>::PreparedAsset`. Defining vertex and fragment shaders is also more verbose than it needs to be.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Say hello to the new `Material` system:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup, TypeUuid, Debug, Clone)]
    #[uuid = "f690fdae-d598-45ab-8225-97e2a3f056e0"]
    pub struct CoolMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        #[texture(1)]
        #[sampler(2)]
        color_texture: Handle<Image>,
    }
    impl Material for CoolMaterial {
        fn fragment_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "cool_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Thats it! This same material would have required [~80 lines of complicated "type heavy" code](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.7.0/examples/shader/shader_material.rs) in the old Material system. Now it is just 14 lines of simple, readable code.
    
    This is thanks to a new consolidated `Material` trait and the new `AsBindGroup` trait / derive.
    
    ### The new `Material` trait
    
    The old "split" `Material` and `SpecializedMaterial` traits have been removed in favor of a new consolidated `Material` trait. All of the functions on the trait are optional.
    
    The difficulty of implementing `Material` has been reduced by simplifying dataflow and removing type complexity:
    
    ```rust
    // Old
    impl Material for CustomMaterial {
        fn fragment_shader(asset_server: &AssetServer) -> Option<Handle<Shader>> {
            Some(asset_server.load("custom_material.wgsl"))
        }
    
        fn alpha_mode(render_asset: &<Self as RenderAsset>::PreparedAsset) -> AlphaMode {
            render_asset.alpha_mode
        }
    }
    
    // New
    impl Material for CustomMaterial {
        fn fragment_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "custom_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    
        fn alpha_mode(&self) -> AlphaMode {
            self.alpha_mode
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Specialization is still supported, but it is hidden by default under the `specialize()` function (more on this later).
    
    ### The `AsBindGroup` trait / derive
    
    The `Material` trait now requires the `AsBindGroup` derive. This can be implemented manually relatively easily, but deriving it will almost always be preferable.
    
    Field attributes like `uniform` and `texture` are used to define which fields should be bindings,
    what their binding type is, and what index they should be bound at:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
    struct CoolMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        #[texture(1)]
        #[sampler(2)]
        color_texture: Handle<Image>,
    }
    ```
    
    In WGSL shaders, the binding looks like this:
    
    ```wgsl
    struct CoolMaterial {
        color: vec4<f32>;
    };
    
    [[group(1), binding(0)]]
    var<uniform> material: CoolMaterial;
    [[group(1), binding(1)]]
    var color_texture: texture_2d<f32>;
    [[group(1), binding(2)]]
    var color_sampler: sampler;
    ```
    
    Note that the "group" index is determined by the usage context. It is not defined in `AsBindGroup`. Bevy material bind groups are bound to group 1.
    
    The following field-level attributes are supported:
    * `uniform(BINDING_INDEX)`
        * The field will be converted to a shader-compatible type using the `ShaderType` trait, written to a `Buffer`, and bound as a uniform. It can also be derived for custom structs.
    * `texture(BINDING_INDEX)`
        * This field's `Handle<Image>` will be used to look up the matching `Texture` gpu resource, which will be bound as a texture in shaders. The field will be assumed to implement `Into<Option<Handle<Image>>>`. In practice, most fields should be a `Handle<Image>` or `Option<Handle<Image>>`. If the value of an `Option<Handle<Image>>` is `None`, the new `FallbackImage` resource will be used instead. This attribute can be used in conjunction with a `sampler` binding attribute (with a different binding index).
    * `sampler(BINDING_INDEX)`
        * Behaves exactly like the `texture` attribute, but sets the Image's sampler binding instead of the texture.
    
    Note that fields without field-level binding attributes will be ignored.
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
    struct CoolMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        this_field_is_ignored: String,
    }
    ```
    
    As mentioned above, `Option<Handle<Image>>` is also supported:
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
    struct CoolMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        #[texture(1)]
        #[sampler(2)]
        color_texture: Option<Handle<Image>>,
    }
    ```
    This is useful if you want a texture to be optional. When the value is `None`, the `FallbackImage` will be used for the binding instead, which defaults to "pure white".
    
    Field uniforms with the same binding index will be combined into a single binding:
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
    struct CoolMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        #[uniform(0)]
        roughness: f32,
    }
    ```
    
    In WGSL shaders, the binding would look like this:
    ```wgsl
    struct CoolMaterial {
        color: vec4<f32>;
        roughness: f32;
    };
    
    [[group(1), binding(0)]]
    var<uniform> material: CoolMaterial;
    ```
    
    Some less common scenarios will require "struct-level" attributes. These are the currently supported struct-level attributes:
    * `uniform(BINDING_INDEX, ConvertedShaderType)`
        * Similar to the field-level `uniform` attribute, but instead the entire `AsBindGroup` value is converted to `ConvertedShaderType`, which must implement `ShaderType`. This is useful if more complicated conversion logic is required.
    * `bind_group_data(DataType)`
        * The `AsBindGroup` type will be converted to some `DataType` using `Into<DataType>` and stored as `AsBindGroup::Data` as part of the `AsBindGroup::as_bind_group` call. This is useful if data needs to be stored alongside the generated bind group, such as a unique identifier for a material's bind group. The most common use case for this attribute is "shader pipeline specialization".
    
    The previous `CoolMaterial` example illustrating "combining multiple field-level uniform attributes with the same binding index" can
    also be equivalently represented with a single struct-level uniform attribute:
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
    #[uniform(0, CoolMaterialUniform)]
    struct CoolMaterial {
        color: Color,
        roughness: f32,
    }
    
    #[derive(ShaderType)]
    struct CoolMaterialUniform {
        color: Color,
        roughness: f32,
    }
    
    impl From<&CoolMaterial> for CoolMaterialUniform {
        fn from(material: &CoolMaterial) -> CoolMaterialUniform {
            CoolMaterialUniform {
                color: material.color,
                roughness: material.roughness,
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Material Specialization
    
    Material shader specialization is now _much_ simpler:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup, TypeUuid, Debug, Clone)]
    #[uuid = "f690fdae-d598-45ab-8225-97e2a3f056e0"]
    #[bind_group_data(CoolMaterialKey)]
    struct CoolMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        is_red: bool,
    }
    
    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Hash, Eq, PartialEq)]
    struct CoolMaterialKey {
        is_red: bool,
    }
    
    impl From<&CoolMaterial> for CoolMaterialKey {
        fn from(material: &CoolMaterial) -> CoolMaterialKey {
            CoolMaterialKey {
                is_red: material.is_red,
            }
        }
    }
    
    impl Material for CoolMaterial {
        fn fragment_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "cool_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    
        fn specialize(
            pipeline: &MaterialPipeline<Self>,
            descriptor: &mut RenderPipelineDescriptor,
            layout: &MeshVertexBufferLayout,
            key: MaterialPipelineKey<Self>,
        ) -> Result<(), SpecializedMeshPipelineError> {
            if key.bind_group_data.is_red {
                let fragment = descriptor.fragment.as_mut().unwrap();
                fragment.shader_defs.push("IS_RED".to_string());
            }
            Ok(())
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Setting `bind_group_data` is not required for specialization (it defaults to `()`). Scenarios like "custom vertex attributes" also benefit from this system:
    ```rust
    impl Material for CustomMaterial {
        fn vertex_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "custom_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    
        fn fragment_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "custom_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    
        fn specialize(
            pipeline: &MaterialPipeline<Self>,
            descriptor: &mut RenderPipelineDescriptor,
            layout: &MeshVertexBufferLayout,
            key: MaterialPipelineKey<Self>,
        ) -> Result<(), SpecializedMeshPipelineError> {
            let vertex_layout = layout.get_layout(&[
                Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION.at_shader_location(0),
                ATTRIBUTE_BLEND_COLOR.at_shader_location(1),
            ])?;
            descriptor.vertex.buffers = vec![vertex_layout];
            Ok(())
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Ported `StandardMaterial` to the new `Material` system
    
    Bevy's built-in PBR material uses the new Material system (including the AsBindGroup derive):
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(AsBindGroup, Debug, Clone, TypeUuid)]
    #[uuid = "7494888b-c082-457b-aacf-517228cc0c22"]
    #[bind_group_data(StandardMaterialKey)]
    #[uniform(0, StandardMaterialUniform)]
    pub struct StandardMaterial {
        pub base_color: Color,
        #[texture(1)]
        #[sampler(2)]
        pub base_color_texture: Option<Handle<Image>>,
        /* other fields omitted for brevity */
    ```
    
    ### Ported Bevy examples to the new `Material` system
    
    The overall complexity of Bevy's "custom shader examples" has gone down significantly. Take a look at the diffs if you want a dopamine spike.
    
    Please note that while this PR has a net increase in "lines of code", most of those extra lines come from added documentation. There is a significant reduction
    in the overall complexity of the code (even accounting for the new derive logic).

    * `AsBindGroup` trait and derive, which make it much easier to transfer data to the gpu and generate bind groups for a given type.
    
    ### Changed
    
    * The old `Material` and `SpecializedMaterial` traits have been replaced by a consolidated (much simpler) `Material` trait. Materials no longer implement `RenderAsset`.
    * `StandardMaterial` was ported to the new material system. There are no user-facing api changes to the `StandardMaterial` struct api, but it now implements `AsBindGroup` and `Material` instead of `RenderAsset` and `SpecializedMaterial`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    The Material system has been reworked to be much simpler. We've removed a lot of boilerplate with the new `AsBindGroup` derive and the `Material` trait is simpler as well!

    impl Material for CustomMaterial {
        fn fragment_shader() -> ShaderRef {
            "custom_material.wgsl".into()
        }
    }
    
    #[derive(AsBindGroup, TypeUuid, Debug, Clone)]
    #[uuid = "f690fdae-d598-45ab-8225-97e2a3f056e0"]
    pub struct CustomMaterial {
        #[uniform(0)]
        color: Color,
        #[texture(1)]
        #[sampler(2)]
        color_texture: Handle<Image>,
    }
    ```
    
    ## Future Work
    
    * Add support for more binding types (cubemaps, buffers, etc). This PR intentionally includes a bare minimum number of binding types to keep "reviewability" in check.
    * Consider optionally eliding binding indices using binding names. `AsBindGroup` could pass in (optional?) reflection info as a "hint".
        * This would make it possible for the derive to do this:
            ```rust
            #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
            pub struct CustomMaterial {
                #[uniform]
                color: Color,
                #[texture]
                #[sampler]
                color_texture: Option<Handle<Image>>,
                alpha_mode: AlphaMode,
            }
            ```
        * Or this
            ```rust
            #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
            pub struct CustomMaterial {
                #[binding]
                color: Color,
                #[binding]
                color_texture: Option<Handle<Image>>,
                alpha_mode: AlphaMode,
            }
            ```
        * Or even this (if we flip to "include bindings by default")
            ```rust
            #[derive(AsBindGroup)]
            pub struct CustomMaterial {
                color: Color,
                color_texture: Option<Handle<Image>>,
                #[binding(ignore)]
                alpha_mode: AlphaMode,
            }
            ```
    * If we add the option to define custom draw functions for materials (which could be done in a type-erased way), I think that would be enough to support extra non-material bindings. Worth considering!

    android - fix issues other than the rendering (#5130)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make Bevy work on android
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Update android metadata and add a few more
    - Set the target sdk to 31 as it will soon (in august) be the minimum sdk level for play store
    - Remove the custom code to create an activity and use ndk-glue macro instead
    - Delay window creation event on android
    - Set the example with compatibility settings for wgpu. Those are needed for Bevy to work on my 2019 android tablet
    - Add a few details on how to debug in case of failures
    - Fix running the example on emulator. This was failing because of the name of the example
    
    Bevy still doesn't work on android with this, audio features need to be disabled because of an ndk-glue version mismatch: rodio depends on 0.6.2, winit on 0.5.2. You can test with:
    ```
    cargo apk run --release --example android_example --no-default-features --features "bevy_winit,render"
    ```

    Add ability to inspect entity's components (#5136)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Provide a way to see the components of an entity.
    - Fixes #1467
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `World::inspect_entity`. It accepts an `Entity` and returns a vector of `&ComponentInfo` that the entity has.
    - Add `EntityCommands::log_components`. It logs the component names of the entity. (info level)

    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    - Ability to inspect components of an entity through `World::inspect_entity` or `EntityCommands::log_components`

    Update `ExactSizeIterator` impl to support archetypal filters (With, Without) (#5124)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #3142
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Done according to #3142
    - Created new marker trait `ArchetypeFilter`
    - Implement said trait to:
      - `With<T>`
      - `Without<T>`
      - tuples containing only types that implement `ArchetypeFilter`, from 0 to 15 elements
      - `Or<T>` where T is a tuple as described previously
    - Changed `ExactSizeIterator` impl to include a new generic that must implement `WorldQuery` and `ArchetypeFilter`
    - Added new tests
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    - `Query`s with archetypal filters can now use `.iter().len()` to get the exact size of the iterator.

    Documenting `BufferVec`. (#4673)
    
    # Objective
    
    Documents the `BufferVec` render resource.
    
    `BufferVec` is a fairly low level object, that will likely be managed by a higher level API (e.g. through [`encase`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4272)) in the future. For now, since it is still used by some simple
    example crates (e.g. [bevy-vertex-pulling](https://github.com/superdump/bevy-vertex-pulling)), it will be helpful
    to provide some simple documentation on what `BufferVec` does.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I looked through Discord discussion on `BufferVec`, and found [a comment](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/953222550568173580/956596218857918464 ) by @superdump to be particularly helpful, in the general discussion around `encase`.
    
    I have taken care to clarify where the data is stored (host-side), when the device-side buffer is created (through calls to `reserve`), and when data writes from host to device are scheduled (using `write_buffer` calls).
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added doc string for `BufferVec` and two of its methods: `reserve` and `write_buffer`.

    Array texture example (#5077)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make the reusable PBR shading functionality a little more reusable
      - Add constructor functions for `StandardMaterial` and `PbrInput` structs to populate them with default values
      - Document unclear `PbrInput` members
    - Demonstrate how to reuse the bevy PBR shading functionality
    - The final important piece from #3969 as the initial shot at making the PBR shader code reusable in custom materials
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add back and rework the 'old' `array_texture` example from pre-0.6.
    - Create a custom shader material
      - Use a single array texture binding and sampler for the material bind group
      - Use a shader that calls `pbr()` from the `bevy_pbr::pbr_functions` import
    - Spawn a row of cubes using the custom material
    - In the shader, select the array texture layer to sample by using the world position x coordinate modulo the number of array texture layers

    Directly copy moved Table components to the target location (#5056)
    
    # Objective
    Speed up entity moves between tables by reducing the number of copies conducted. Currently three separate copies are conducted: `src[index] -> swap scratch`, `src[last] -> src[index]`, and `swap scratch -> dst[target]`. The first and last copies can be merged by directly using the copy `src[index] -> dst[target]`, which can save quite some time if the component(s) in question are large.

     - Adds `BlobVec::swap_remove_unchecked(usize, PtrMut<'_>)`, which is identical to `swap_remove_and_forget_unchecked`, but skips the `swap_scratch` and directly copies the component into the provided `PtrMut<'_>`.
     - Build `Column::initialize_from_unchecked(&mut Column, usize, usize)` on top of it, which uses the above to directly initialize a row from another column.
     - Update most of the table move APIs to use `initialize_from_unchecked` instead of a combination of `swap_remove_and_forget_unchecked` and `initialize`.
    
    This is an alternative, though orthogonal, approach to achieve the same performance gains as seen in #4853. This (hopefully) shouldn't run into the same Miri limitations that said PR currently does.  After this PR, `swap_remove_and_forget_unchecked` is still in use for Resources and swap_scratch likely still should be removed, so #4853 still has use, even if this PR is merged.
    
    ## Performance
    TODO: Microbenchmark
    
    This PR shows similar improvements to commands that add or remove table components that result in a table move. When tested on `many_cubes sphere`, some of the more command heavy systems saw notable improvements. In particular, `prepare_uniform_components<T>`, this saw a reduction in time from 1.35ms to 1.13ms (a 16.3% improvement) on my local machine, a similar if not slightly better gain than what #4853 showed [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4853#issuecomment-1159346106).

    The command heavy `Extract` stage also saw a smaller overall improvement:

    Make `Reflect` safe to implement (#5010)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, `Reflect` is unsafe to implement because of a contract in which `any` and `any_mut` must return `self`, or `downcast` will cause UB. This PR makes `Reflect` safe, makes `downcast` not use unsafe, and eliminates this contract.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR adds a method to `Reflect`, `any`. It also renames the old `any` to `as_any`.
    `any` now takes a `Box<Self>` and returns a `Box<dyn Any>`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added:
    - `any()` method
    - `represents()` method
    
    ### Changed:
    - `Reflect` is now a safe trait
    - `downcast()` is now safe
    - The old `any` is now called `as_any`, and `any_mut` is now `as_mut_any`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Reflect derives should not have to change anything
    - Manual reflect impls will need to remove the `unsafe` keyword, add `any()` implementations, and rename the old `any` and `any_mut` to `as_any` and `as_mut_any`.
    - Calls to `any`/`any_mut` must be changed to `as_any`/`as_mut_any`
    
    ## Points of discussion:
    
    - Should renaming `any` be avoided and instead name the new method `any_box`?
    - ~~Could there be a performance regression from avoiding the unsafe? I doubt it, but this change does seem to introduce redundant checks.~~
    - ~~Could/should `is` and `type_id()` be implemented differently? For example, moving `is` onto `Reflect` as an `fn(&self, TypeId) -> bool`~~

    Update `MouseMotion` and `CursorMoved` docs (#5090)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #5083
    
    ## Solution
    
    I looked at the implementation of those events. I noticed that they both are adaptations of `winit`'s `DeviceEvent`/`WindowEvent` enum variants. Therefore I based the description of the items on the documentation provided by the upstream crate. I also added a link to `CursorMoved`, just like `MouseMotion` already has.
    
    ## Observations
    
    - Looking at the implementation of `MouseMotion`, I noticed the `DeviceId` field of the `winit` event is discarded by `bevy_input`. This means that in the case a machine has multiple pointing devices, it is impossible to distinguish to which one the event is referring to. **EDIT:** just tested, `MouseMotion` events are emitted for movement of both mice.

    Examples metadata in Cargo.toml (#4741)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Have information about examples only in one place that can be used for the repo and for the website (and remove the need to keep a list of example to build for wasm in the website https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/blob/75acb730406ef9c5928d37daf8bb32e4dbeb8b13/generate-wasm-examples/generate_wasm_examples.sh#L92-L99)
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add metadata about examples in `Cargo.toml`
    - Build the `examples/README.md` from a template using those metadata. I used tera as the template engine to use the same tech as the website.
    - Make CI fail if an example is missing metadata, or if the readme file needs to be updated (the command to update it is displayed in the failed step in CI)
    
    ## Remaining To Do
    
    - After the next release with this merged in, the website will be able to be updated to use those metadata too
    - I would like to build the examples in wasm and make them available at http://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/ but that will require more design

    Allow unbatched render phases to use unstable sorts (#5049)
    
    # Objective
    
    Partially addresses #4291.
    
    Speed up the sort phase for unbatched render phases.
    
    ## Solution
    Split out one of the optimizations in #4899 and allow implementors of `PhaseItem` to change what kind of sort is used when sorting the items in the phase. This currently includes Stable, Unstable, and Unsorted. Each of these corresponds to `Vec::sort_by_key`, `Vec::sort_unstable_by_key`, and no sorting at all. The default is `Unstable`. The last one can be used as a default if users introduce a preliminary depth prepass.
    
    ## Performance
    This will not impact the performance of any batched phases, as it is still using a stable sort. 2D's only phase is unchanged. All 3D phases are unbatched currently, and will benefit from this change.
    
    On `many_cubes`, where the primary phase is opaque, this change sees a speed up from 907.02us -> 477.62us, a 47.35% reduction.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3137680/174471253-22424874-30d5-4db5-b5b4-65fb2c612a9c.png)
    
    ## Future Work
    There were prior discussions to add support for faster radix sorts in #4291, which in theory should be a `O(n)` instead of a `O(nlog(n))` time. [`voracious`](https://crates.io/crates/voracious_radix_sort) has been proposed, but it seems to be optimize for use cases with more than 30,000 items, which may be atypical for most systems.
    
    Another optimization included in #4899 is to reduce the size of a few of the IDs commonly used in `PhaseItem` implementations to shrink the types to make swapping/sorting faster. Both `CachedPipelineId` and `DrawFunctionId` could be reduced to `u32` instead of `usize`.
    
    Ideally, this should automatically change to use stable sorts when `BatchedPhaseItem` is implemented on the same phase item type, but this requires specialization, which may not land in stable Rust for a short while.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Added: `PhaseItem::sort`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    RenderPhases now default to a unstable sort (via `slice::sort_unstable_by_key`). This can typically improve sort phase performance, but may produce incorrect batching results when implementing `BatchedPhaseItem`. To revert to the older stable sort, manually implement `PhaseItem::sort` to implement a stable sort (i.e. via `slice::sort_by_key`).

    depend on dioxus(and bevy)-maintained fork of stretch (taffy) (#4716)
    
    # Objective
    
    DioxusLabs and Bevy have taken over maintaining what was our abandoned ui layout dependency [stretch](https://github.com/vislyhq/stretch). Dioxus' fork has had a lot of work done on it by @alice-i-cecile, @Weibye , @jkelleyrtp, @mockersf, @HackerFoo, @TimJentzsch and a dozen other contributors and now is in much better shape than stretch was. The updated crate is called taffy and is available on github [here](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) ([taffy](https://crates.io/crates/taffy) on crates.io). The goal of this PR is to replace stretch v0.3.2 with taffy v0.1.0.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I changed the bevy_ui Cargo.toml to depend on taffy instead of stretch and fixed all the errors rustc complained about.

    Callable PBR functions (#4939)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Builds on top of #4938
    - Make clustered-forward PBR lighting/shadows functionality callable
    - See #3969 for details
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `PbrInput` struct type containing a `StandardMaterial`, occlusion, world_position, world_normal, and frag_coord
    - Split functionality to calculate the unit view vector, and normal-mapped normal into `bevy_pbr::pbr_functions`
    - Split high-level shading flow into `pbr(in: PbrInput, N: vec3<f32>, V: vec3<f32>, is_orthographic: bool)` function in `bevy_pbr::pbr_functions`
    - Rework `pbr.wgsl` fragment stage entry point to make use of the new functions
    - This has been benchmarked on an M1 Max using `many_cubes -- sphere`. `main` had a median frame time of 15.88ms, this PR 15.99ms, which is a 0.69% frame time increase, which is within noise in my opinion.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added: PBR shading code is now callable. Import `bevy_pbr::pbr_functions` and its dependencies, create a `PbrInput`, calculate the unit view and normal-mapped normal vectors and whether the projection is orthographic, and call `pbr()`!

    Mark mutable APIs under ECS storage as pub(crate) (#5065)
    
    # Objective
    Closes #1557. Partially addresses #3362.
    
    Cleanup the public facing API for storage types. Most of these APIs are difficult to use safely when directly interfacing with these types, and is also currently impossible to interact with in normal ECS use as there is no `World::storages_mut`. The majority of these types should be easy enough to read, and perhaps mutate the contents, but never structurally altered without the same checks in the rest of bevy_ecs code. This both cleans up the public facing types and helps use unused code detection to remove a few of the APIs we're not using internally.
    
    ## Solution
    
     - Mark all APIs that take `&mut T` under `bevy_ecs::storage` as `pub(crate)` or `pub(super)`
     - Cleanup after it all.
    
    Entire type visibility changes:
    
     - `BlobVec` is `pub(super)`, only storage code should be directly interacting with it.
     - `SparseArray` is now `pub(crate)` for the entire type. It's an implementation detail for `Table` and `(Component)SparseSet`.
     - `TableMoveResult` is now `pub(crate)

    Change check_visibility to use thread-local queues instead of a channel (#4663)
    
    # Objective
    Further speed up visibility checking by removing the main sources of contention for the system.
    
    ## Solution
     - ~~Make `ComputedVisibility` a resource wrapping a `FixedBitset`.~~
     - ~~Remove `ComputedVisibility` as a component.~~
    
    ~~This adds a one-bit overhead to every entity in the app world. For a game with 100,000 entities, this is 12.5KB of memory. This is still small enough to fit entirely in most L1 caches. Also removes the need for a per-Entity change detection tick. This reduces the memory footprint of ComputedVisibility 72x.~~
    
    ~~The decreased memory usage and less fragmented memory locality should provide significant performance benefits.~~
    
    ~~Clearing visible entities should be significantly faster than before:~~
    
     - ~~Setting one `u32` to 0 clears 32 entities per cycle.~~
     - ~~No archetype fragmentation to contend with.~~
     - ~~Change detection is applied to the resource, so there is no per-Entity update tick requirement.~~
    
    ~~The side benefit of this design is that it removes one more "computed component" from userspace.  Though accessing the values within it are now less ergonomic.~~
    
    This PR changes `crossbeam_channel` in `check_visibility` to use a `Local<ThreadLocal<Cell<Vec<Entity>>>` to mark down visible entities instead.

    Improve entity and component API docs (#4767)
    
    # Objective
    
    The descriptions included in the API docs of `entity` module, `Entity` struct, and `Component` trait have some issues:
    1. the concept of entity is not clearly defined,
    2. descriptions are a little bit out of place,
    3. in a case the description leak too many details about the implementation,
    4. some descriptions are not exhaustive,
    5. there are not enough examples,
    6. the content can be formatted in a much better way.
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. ~~Stress the fact that entity is an abstract and elementary concept. Abstract because the concept of entity is not hardcoded into the library but emerges from the interaction of `Entity` with every other part of `bevy_ecs`, like components and world methods. Elementary because it is a fundamental concept that cannot be defined with other terms (like point in euclidean geometry, or time in classical physics).~~ We decided to omit the definition of entity in the API docs ([see why]). It is only described in its relationship with components.
    2. Information has been moved to relevant places and links are used instead in the other places.
    3. Implementation details about `Entity` have been reduced.
    4. Descriptions have been made more exhaustive by stating how to obtain and use items. Entity operations are enriched with `World` methods.
    5. Examples have been added or enriched.
    6. Sections have been added to organize content. Entity operations are now laid out in a table.
    
    ### Todo list
    
    - [x] Break lines at sentence-level.
    
    ## For reviewers
    
    - ~~I added a TODO over `Component` docs, make sure to check it out and discuss it if necessary.~~ ([Resolved])
    - You can easily check the rendered documentation by doing `cargo doc -p bevy_ecs --no-deps --open`.

    Fixed bevy_ui touch input (#4099)
    
    # Objective
    
    `bevy_ui` doesn't support correctly touch inputs because of two problems in the focus system:
    - It attempts to retrieve touch input with a specific `0` id
    - It doesn't retrieve touch positions and bases its focus solely on mouse position, absent from mobile devices
    
    ## Solution
    
    I added a few methods to the `Touches` resource, allowing to check if **any** touch input was pressed, released or cancelled and to retrieve the *position* of the first pressed touch input and adapted the focus system.
    
    I added a test button to the *iOS* example and it works correclty on emulator. I did not test on a real touch device as:
    - Android is not working (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3249)
    - I don't have an iOS device

    Fix redundant "have" in CONTRIBUTING (#5036)
    
    **This Commit**
    
    1. Makes it so the sentence doesn't read "are contributors who have Have
       actively ..."
    2. Makes it so all three bullet points end in punctuation
    
    **Notes**
    Could also remove the leading "Have" from all bullet points and leave it
    on the previous sentence. That's the least redundant but I guess this is
    more flexible if we want to add a sentence that doesn't start with
    "Have" later.

    change panicking test to not run on global task pool (#4998)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #4996
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Panicking on the global task pool is probably bad. This changes the panicking test to use a single threaded stage to run the test instead.
    - I checked the other #[should_panic]
    - I also added explicit ordering between the transform propagate system and the parent update system. The ambiguous ordering didn't seem to be causing problems, but the tests are probably more correct this way. The plugins that add these systems have an explicit ordering. I can remove this if necessary.
    
    ## Note
    
    I don't have a 100% mental model of why panicking is causing intermittent failures. It probably has to do with a task for one of the other tests landing on the panicking thread when it actually panics. Why this causes a problem I'm not sure, but this PR seems to fix things.
    
    ## Open questions
    
    - there are some other #[should_panic] tests that run on the task pool in stage.rs. I don't think we restart panicked threads, so this might be killing most of the threads on the pool. But since they're not causing test failures, we should probably decide what to do about that separately. The solution in this PR won't work since those tests are explicitly testing parallelism.

    `bevy_reflect`: put `serialize` into external `ReflectSerialize` type (#4782)
    
    builds on top of #4780
    
    # Objective
    
    `Reflect` and `Serialize` are currently very tied together because `Reflect` has a `fn serialize(&self) -> Option<Serializable<'_>>` method. Because of that, we can either implement `Reflect` for types like `Option<T>` with `T: Serialize` and have `fn serialize` be implemented, or without the bound but having `fn serialize` return `None`.
    
    By separating `ReflectSerialize` into a separate type (like how it already is for `ReflectDeserialize`, `ReflectDefault`), we could separately `.register::<Option<T>>()` and `.register_data::<Option<T>, ReflectSerialize>()` only if the type `T: Serialize`.
    
    This PR does not change the registration but allows it to be changed in a future PR.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - add the type
    ```rust
    struct ReflectSerialize { .. }
    impl<T: Reflect + Serialize> FromType<T> for ReflectSerialize { .. }
    ```
    
    - remove `#[reflect(Serialize)]` special casing.
    
    - when serializing reflect value types, look for `ReflectSerialize` in the `TypeRegistry` instead of calling `value.serialize()`

    - changed `EntityCountDiagnosticsPlugin` to not use an exclusive system to get its entity count
    - removed mention of `WgpuResourceDiagnosticsPlugin` in example `log_diagnostics` as it doesn't exist anymore
    - added ability to enable, disable ~~or toggle~~ a diagnostic (fix #3767)
    - made diagnostic values lazy, so they are only computed if the diagnostic is enabled
    - do not log an average for diagnostics with only one value
    - removed `sum` function from diagnostic as it isn't really useful
    - ~~do not keep an average of the FPS diagnostic. it is already an average on the last 20 frames, so the average FPS was an average of the last 20 frames over the last 20 frames~~
    - do not compute the FPS value as an average over the last 20 frames but give the actual "instant FPS"
    - updated log format to use variable capture
    - added some doc
    - the frame counter diagnostic value can be reseted to 0

    enable optional dependencies to stay optional (#5023)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Optional dependencies were enabled by some features as a side effect. for example, enabling the `webgl` feature enables the `bevy_pbr` optional dependency
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use the syntax introduced in rust 1.60 to specify weak dependency features: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html#new-syntax-for-cargo-features
    
    > Weak dependency features tackle the second issue where the `"optional-dependency/feature-name"` syntax would always enable `optional-dependency`. However, often you want to enable the feature on the optional dependency only if some other feature has enabled the optional dependency. Starting in 1.60, you can add a ? as in `"package-name?/feature-name"` which will only enable the given feature if something else has enabled the optional dependency.

    bevy_render: Fix KTX2 UASTC format mapping (#4569)
    
    # Objective
    
    - KTX2 UASTC format mapping was incorrect. For some reason I had written it to map to a set of data formats based on the count of KTX2 sample information blocks, but the mapping should be done based on the channel type in the sample information.
    - This is a valid change pulled out from #4514 as the attempt to fix the array textures there was incorrect
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Fix the KTX2 UASTC `DataFormat` enum to contain the correct formats based on the channel types in section 3.10.2 of https://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/ (search for "Basis Universal UASTC Format")
    - Correctly map from the sample information channel type to `DataFormat`
    - Correctly configure transcoding and the resulting texture format based on the `DataFormat`

    bevy_render: Add `attributes` and `attributes_mut` methods to `Mesh`. (#3927)
    
    # Use Case
    
    Seems generally useful, but specifically motivated by my work on the [`bevy_datasize`](https://github.com/BGR360/bevy_datasize) crate.
    
    For that project, I'm implementing "heap size estimators" for all of the Bevy internal types. To do this accurately for `Mesh`, I need to get the lengths of all of the mesh's attribute vectors.
    
    Currently, in order to accomplish this, I am doing the following:
    
    * Checking all of the attributes that are mentioned in the `Mesh` class ([see here](https://github.com/BGR360/bevy_datasize/blob/0531ec2d026085a31e937b12d5ecf4109005e737/src/builtins/render/mesh.rs#L46-L54))
    
    * Providing the user with an option to configure additional attributes to check ([see here](https://github.com/BGR360/bevy_datasize/blob/0531ec2d026085a31e937b12d5ecf4109005e737/src/config.rs#L7-L21))
    
    This is both overly complicated and a bit wasteful (since I have to check every attribute name that I know about in case there are attributes set for it).

    Parallel Frustum Culling (#4489)
    
    # Objective
    
    Working with a large number of entities with `Aabbs`, rendered with an instanced shader, I found the bottleneck became the frustum culling system. The goal of this PR is to significantly improve culling performance without any major changes. We should consider constructing a BVH for more substantial improvements.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Convert the inner entity query to a parallel iterator with `par_for_each_mut` using a batch size of 1,024.
    - This outperforms single threaded culling when there are more than 1,000 entities.
      - Below this they are approximately equal, with <= 10 microseconds of multithreading overhead.
      - Above this, the multithreaded version is significantly faster, scaling linearly with core count.
    - In my million-entity-workload, this PR improves my framerate by 200% - 300%.

    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    Frustum culling is now run with a parallel query. When culling more than a thousand entities, this is faster than the previous method, scaling proportionally with the number of available cores.

    - Add reusable shader functions for transforming positions / normals / tangents between local and world / clip space for 2D and 3D so that they are done in a simple and correct way
    - The next step in #3969 so check there for more details.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `bevy_pbr::mesh_functions` and `bevy_sprite::mesh2d_functions` shader imports
      - These contain `mesh_` and `mesh2d_` versions of the following functions:
        - `mesh_position_local_to_world`
        - `mesh_position_world_to_clip`
        - `mesh_position_local_to_clip`
        - `mesh_normal_local_to_world`
        - `mesh_tangent_local_to_world`
    - Use them everywhere where it is appropriate
      - Notably not in the sprite and UI shaders where `mesh2d_position_world_to_clip` could have been used, but including all the functions depends on the mesh binding so I chose to not use the function there
    - NOTE: The `mesh_` and `mesh2d_` functions are currently identical. However, if I had defined only `bevy_pbr::mesh_functions` and used that in bevy_sprite, then bevy_sprite would have a runtime dependency on bevy_pbr, which seems undesirable. I also expect that when we have a proper 2D rendering API, these functions will diverge between 2D and 3D.

    ## Changelog
    
    - Added: `bevy_pbr::mesh_functions` and `bevy_sprite::mesh2d_functions` shader imports containing `mesh_` and `mesh2d_` versions of the following functions:
      - `mesh_position_local_to_world`
      - `mesh_position_world_to_clip`
      - `mesh_position_local_to_clip`
      - `mesh_normal_local_to_world`
      - `mesh_tangent_local_to_world`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - The `skin_tangents` function from the `bevy_pbr::skinning` shader import has been replaced with the `mesh_tangent_local_to_world` function from the `bevy_pbr::mesh_functions` shader import

    Replace `ReadOnlyFetch` with `ReadOnlyWorldQuery` (#4626)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fix a type inference regression introduced by #3001
    - Make read only bounds on world queries more user friendly
    
    ptrification required you to write `Q::Fetch: ReadOnlyFetch` as `for<'w> QueryFetch<'w, Q>: ReadOnlyFetch` which has the same type inference problem as `for<'w> QueryFetch<'w, Q>: FilterFetch<'w>` had, i.e. the following code would error:
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct Foo;
    
    fn bar(a: Query<(&Foo, Without<Foo>)>) {
        foo(a);
    }
    
    fn foo<Q: WorldQuery>(a: Query<Q, ()>)
    where
        for<'w> QueryFetch<'w, Q>: ReadOnlyFetch,
    {
    }
    ```
    `for<..>` bounds are also rather user unfriendly..
    
    ## Solution
    
    Remove the `ReadOnlyFetch` trait in favour of a `ReadOnlyWorldQuery` trait, and remove `WorldQueryGats::ReadOnlyFetch` in favor of `WorldQuery::ReadOnly` allowing the previous code snippet to be written as:
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct Foo;
    
    fn bar(a: Query<(&Foo, Without<Foo>)>) {
        foo(a);
    }
    
    fn foo<Q: ReadOnlyWorldQuery>(a: Query<Q, ()>) {}
    ```
    This avoids the `for<...>` bound which makes the code simpler and also fixes the type inference issue.
    
    The reason for moving the two functions out of `FetchState` and into `WorldQuery` is to allow the world query `&mut T` to share a `State` with the `&T` world query so that it can have `type ReadOnly = &T`. Presumably it would be possible to instead have a `ReadOnlyRefMut<T>` world query and then do `type ReadOnly = ReadOnlyRefMut<T>` much like how (before this PR) we had a `ReadOnlyWriteFetch<T>`. A side benefit of the current solution in this PR is that it will likely make it easier in the future to support an API such as `Query<&mut T> -> Query<&T>`. The primary benefit IMO is just that `ReadOnlyRefMut<T>` and its associated fetch would have to reimplement all of the logic that the `&T` world query impl does but this solution avoids that :)
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog/Migration Guide
    
    The trait `ReadOnlyFetch` has been replaced with `ReadOnlyWorldQuery` along with the `WorldQueryGats::ReadOnlyFetch` assoc type which has been replaced with `<WorldQuery::ReadOnly as WorldQueryGats>::Fetch`
    - Any where clauses such as `QueryFetch<Q>: ReadOnlyFetch` should be replaced with `Q: ReadOnlyWorldQuery`.
    - Any custom world query impls should implement `ReadOnlyWorldQuery` insead of `ReadOnlyFetch`
    
    Functions `update_component_access` and `update_archetype_component_access` have been moved from the `FetchState` trait to `WorldQuery`
    - Any callers should now call `Q::update_component_access(state` instead of `state.update_component_access` (and `update_archetype_component_access` respectively)
    - Any custom world query impls should move the functions from the `FetchState` impl to `WorldQuery` impl
    
    `WorldQuery` has been made an `unsafe trait`, `FetchState` has been made a safe `trait`. (I think this is how it should have always been, but regardless this is _definitely_ necessary now that the two functions have been moved to `WorldQuery`)
    - If you have a custom `FetchState` impl make it a normal `impl` instead of `unsafe impl`
    - If you have a custom `WorldQuery` impl make it an `unsafe impl`, if your code was sound before it is going to still be sound

    bevy_log: upgrade to tracing-tracy 0.10.0 (#4991)
    
    This upgrade should bring some significant performance improvements to
    instrumentation. These are mostly achieved by disabling features (by
    default) that are likely not widely used by default – collection of
    callstacks and support for fibers that wasn't used for anything in
    particular yet. For callstack collection it might be worthwhile to
    provide a mechanism to enable this at runtime by calling
    `TracyLayer::with_stackdepth`.
    
    These should bring the cost of a single span down from 30+µs per span to
    a more reasonable 1.5µs or so and down to the ns scale for events (on my
    1st gen Ryzen machine, anyway.) There is still a fair amount of overhead
    over plain tracy_client instrumentation in formatting and such, but
    dealing with it requires significant effort and this is a
    straightforward improvement to have for the time being.

    Overflow::Hidden doesn't work correctly with scale_factor_override (#3854)
    
    # Objective
    
    Overflow::Hidden doesn't work correctly with scale_factor_override.
    If you run the Bevy UI example with scale_factor_override 3 you'll see half clipped text around the edges of the scrolling listbox.
    The problem seems to be that the corners of the node are transformed before the amount of clipping required is calculated. But then that transformed clip is compared to the original untransformed size of the node rect to see if it should be culled or not. With a higher scale factor the relative size of the untransformed node rect is going to be really big, so the overflow isn't culled.
    
    # Solution
    
    Multiply the size of the node rect by extracted_uinode.transform before the cull test.

    bevy_reflect: Add statically available type info for reflected types (#4042)
    
    # Objective
    
    > Resolves #4504
    
    It can be helpful to have access to type information without requiring an instance of that type. Especially for `Reflect`, a lot of the gathered type information is known at compile-time and should not necessarily require an instance.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Created a dedicated `TypeInfo` enum to store static type information. All types that derive `Reflect` now also implement the newly created `Typed` trait:
    
    ```rust
    pub trait Typed: Reflect {
      fn type_info() -> &'static TypeInfo;
    }
    ```
    
    > Note: This trait was made separate from `Reflect` due to `Sized` restrictions.
    
    If you only have access to a `dyn Reflect`, just call `.get_type_info()` on it. This new trait method on `Reflect` should return the same value as if you had called it statically.
    
    If all you have is a `TypeId` or type name, you can get the `TypeInfo` directly from the registry using the `TypeRegistry::get_type_info` method (assuming it was registered).
    
    ### Usage
    
    Below is an example of working with `TypeInfo`. As you can see, we don't have to generate an instance of `MyTupleStruct` in order to get this information.
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct MyTupleStruct(usize, i32, MyStruct);
    
    let info = MyTupleStruct::type_info();
    if let TypeInfo::TupleStruct(info) = info {
      assert!(info.is::<MyTupleStruct>());
      assert_eq!(std::any::type_name::<MyTupleStruct>(), info.type_name());
      assert!(info.field_at(1).unwrap().is::<i32>());
    } else {
      panic!("Expected `TypeInfo::TupleStruct`");
    }
    ```
    
    ### Manual Implementations
    
    It's not recommended to manually implement `Typed` yourself, but if you must, you can use the `TypeInfoCell` to automatically create and manage the static `TypeInfo`s for you (which is very helpful for blanket/generic impls):
    
    ```rust
    use bevy_reflect::{Reflect, TupleStructInfo, TypeInfo, UnnamedField};
    use bevy_reflect::utility::TypeInfoCell;
    
    struct Foo<T: Reflect>(T);
    
    impl<T: Reflect> Typed for Foo<T> {
      fn type_info() -> &'static TypeInfo {
        static CELL: TypeInfoCell = TypeInfoCell::generic();
        CELL.get_or_insert::<Self, _>(|| {
          let fields = [UnnamedField::new::<T>()];
          let info = TupleStructInfo::new::<Self>(&fields);
          TypeInfo::TupleStruct(info)
        })
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Benefits
    
    One major benefit is that this opens the door to other serialization methods. Since we can get all the type info at compile time, we can know how to properly deserialize something like:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    struct MyType {
      foo: usize,
      bar: Vec<String>
    }
    
    // RON to be deserialized:
    (
      type: "my_crate::MyType", // <- We now know how to deserialize the rest of this object
      value: {
        // "foo" is a value type matching "usize"
        "foo": 123,
        // "bar" is a list type matching "Vec<String>" with item type "String"
        "bar": ["a", "b", "c"]
      }
    )
    ```
    
    Not only is this more compact, but it has better compatibility (we can change the type of `"foo"` to `i32` without having to update our serialized data).
    
    Of course, serialization/deserialization strategies like this may need to be discussed and fully considered before possibly making a change. However, we will be better equipped to do that now that we can access type information right from the registry.
    
    ## Discussion
    
    Some items to discuss:
    
    1. Duplication. There's a bit of overlap with the existing traits/structs since they require an instance of the type while the type info structs do not (for example, `Struct::field_at(&self, index: usize)` and `StructInfo::field_at(&self, index: usize)`, though only `StructInfo` is accessible without an instance object). Is this okay, or do we want to handle it in another way?
    2. Should `TypeInfo::Dynamic` be removed? Since the dynamic types don't have type information available at runtime, we could consider them `TypeInfo::Value`s (or just even just `TypeInfo::Struct`). The intention with `TypeInfo::Dynamic` was to keep the distinction from these dynamic types and actual structs/values since users might incorrectly believe the methods of the dynamic type's info struct would map to some contained data (which isn't possible statically).
    4. General usefulness of this change, including missing/unnecessary parts.
    5. Possible changes to the scene format? (One possible issue with changing it like in the example above might be that we'd have to be careful when handling generic or trait object types.)
    
    ## Compile Tests
    
    I ran a few tests to compare compile times (as suggested [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4042#discussion_r876408143)). I toggled `Reflect` and `FromReflect` derive macros using `cfg_attr` for both this PR (aa5178e7736a6f8252e10e543e52722107649d3f) and main (c309acd4322b1c3b2089e247a2d28b938eb7b56d).
    
    <details>
    <summary>See More</summary>
    
    The test project included 250 of the following structs (as well as a few other structs):
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Default)]
    #[cfg_attr(feature = "reflect", derive(Reflect))]
    #[cfg_attr(feature = "from_reflect", derive(FromReflect))]
    pub struct Big001 {
        inventory: Inventory,
        foo: usize,
        bar: String,
        baz: ItemDescriptor,
        items: [Item; 20],
        hello: Option<String>,
        world: HashMap<i32, String>,
        okay: (isize, usize, /* wesize */),
        nope: ((String, String), (f32, f32)),
        blah: Cow<'static, str>,
    }
    ```
    
    > I don't know if the compiler can optimize all these duplicate structs away, but I think it's fine either way. We're comparing times, not finding the absolute worst-case time.
    
    I only ran each build 3 times using `cargo build --timings` (thank you @devil-ira), each of which were preceeded by a `cargo clean --package bevy_reflect_compile_test`.
    
    Here are the times I got:
    
    | Test                             | Test 1 | Test 2 | Test 3 | Average |
    | -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
    | Main                             | 1.7s   | 3.1s   | 1.9s   | 2.33s   |
    | Main + `Reflect`                 | 8.3s   | 8.6s   | 8.1s   | 8.33s   |
    | Main + `Reflect` + `FromReflect` | 11.6s  | 11.8s  | 13.8s  | 12.4s   |
    | PR                               | 3.5s   | 1.8s   | 1.9s   | 2.4s    |
    | PR + `Reflect`                   | 9.2s   | 8.8s   | 9.3s   | 9.1s    |
    | PR + `Reflect` + `FromReflect`   | 12.9s  | 12.3s  | 12.5s  | 12.56s  |
    
    </details>

    ## Future Work
    
    Even though everything could probably be made `const`, we unfortunately can't. This is because `TypeId::of::<T>()` is not yet `const` (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77125). When it does get stabilized, it would probably be worth coming back and making things `const`.

    add a `SceneBundle` to spawn a scene (#2424)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Spawning a scene is handled as a special case with a command `spawn_scene` that takes an handle but doesn't let you specify anything else. This is the only handle that works that way.
    - Workaround for this have been to add the `spawn_scene` on `ChildBuilder` to be able to specify transform of parent, or to make the `SceneSpawner` available to be able to select entities from a scene by their instance id
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a bundle
    ```rust
    pub struct SceneBundle {
        pub scene: Handle<Scene>,
        pub transform: Transform,
        pub global_transform: GlobalTransform,
        pub instance_id: Option<InstanceId>,
    }
    ```
    
    and instead of
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_scene(asset_server.load("models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet.gltf#Scene0"));
    ```
    you can do
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(SceneBundle {
        scene: asset_server.load("models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet.gltf#Scene0"),
        ..Default::default()
    });
    ```
    
    The scene will be spawned as a child of the entity with the `SceneBundle`
    
    ~I would like to remove the command `spawn_scene` in favor of this bundle but didn't do it yet to get feedback first~

    Following #4855, `Column` is just a parallel `BlobVec`/`Vec<UnsafeCell<ComponentTicks>>` pair, which is identical to the dense and ticks vecs in `ComponentSparseSet`, which has some code duplication with `Column`.
    
    ## Solution
    Replace dense and ticks in `ComponentSparseSet` with a `Column`.

    Implement FusedIterator for eligible Iterator types (#4942)
    
    # Objective
    Most of our `Iterator` impls satisfy the requirements of `std::iter::FusedIterator`, which has internal specialization that optimizes `Interator::fuse`. The std lib iterator combinators do have a few that rely on `fuse`, so this could optimize those use cases. I don't think we're using any of them in the engine itself, but beyond a light increase in compile time, it doesn't hurt to implement the trait.
    
    ## Solution
    Implement the trait for all eligible iterators in first party crates. Also add a missing `ExactSizeIterator` on an iterator that could use it.

    Add global init and get accessors for all newtyped TaskPools (#2250)
    
    Right now, a direct reference to the target TaskPool is required to launch tasks on the pools, despite the three newtyped pools (AsyncComputeTaskPool, ComputeTaskPool, and IoTaskPool) effectively acting as global instances. The need to pass a TaskPool reference adds notable friction to spawning subtasks within existing tasks. Possible use cases for this may include chaining tasks within the same pool like spawning separate send/receive I/O tasks after waiting on a network connection to be established, or allowing cross-pool dependent tasks like starting dependent multi-frame computations following a long I/O load.
    
    Other task execution runtimes provide static access to spawning tasks (i.e. `tokio::spawn`), which is notably easier to use than the reference passing required by `bevy_tasks` right now.
    
    This PR makes does the following:
    
     * Adds `*TaskPool::init` which initializes a `OnceCell`'ed with a provided TaskPool. Failing if the pool has already been initialized.
     * Adds `*TaskPool::get` which fetches the initialized global pool of the respective type or panics. This generally should not be an issue in normal Bevy use, as the pools are initialized before they are accessed.
     * Updated default task pool initialization to either pull the global handles and save them as resources, or if they are already initialized, pull the a cloned global handle as the resource.
    
    This should make it notably easier to build more complex task hierarchies for dependent tasks. It should also make writing bevy-adjacent, but not strictly bevy-only plugin crates easier, as the global pools ensure it's all running on the same threads.
    
    One alternative considered is keeping a thread-local reference to the pool for all threads in each pool to enable the same `tokio::spawn` interface. This would spawn tasks on the same pool that a task is currently running in. However this potentially leads to potential footgun situations where long running blocking tasks run on `ComputeTaskPool`.

    Add "depth_load_op" configuration to 3d Cameras (#4904)
    
    # Objective
    
    Users should be able to configure depth load operations on cameras. Currently every camera clears depth when it is rendered. But sometimes later passes need to rely on depth from previous passes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This adds the `Camera3d::depth_load_op` field with a new `Camera3dDepthLoadOp` value. This is a custom type because Camera3d uses "reverse-z depth" and this helps us record and document that in a discoverable way. It also gives us more control over reflection + other trait impls, whereas `LoadOp` is owned by the `wgpu` crate.
    
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {
        camera_3d: Camera3d {
            depth_load_op: Camera3dDepthLoadOp::Load,
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    });
    ```

    ## Solution
    
    - Adds a `Score` resource and an `EnemyDied` event. An `update_score` system updates the score when a new event comes through. I'm not sure the example is great, as this probably isn't how you'd do it in a real game, but I didn't want to change the existing example too much.

    - add a simple [playwright](https://playwright.dev) test script that opens the browser then waits for the success log, and takes a screenshot
    - add a CI job that runs the playwright test for Chromium and Firefox on one example (lighting) and save the screenshots
      - Firefox screenshot is good (with some clusters visible)

    Add methods for querying lists of entities. (#4879)
    
    # Objective
    Improve querying ergonomics around collections and iterators of entities.
    
    Example how queries over Children might be done currently.
    ```rust
    fn system(foo_query: Query<(&Foo, &Children)>, bar_query: Query<(&Bar, &Children)>) {
        for (foo, children) in &foo_query {
            for child in children.iter() {
                if let Ok((bar, children)) = bar_query.get(*child) {
                    for child in children.iter() {
                        if let Ok((foo, children)) = foo_query.get(*child) {
                            // D:
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Answers #4868
    Partially addresses #4864
    Fixes #1470
    ## Solution
    Based on the great work by @deontologician in #2563
    
    Added `iter_many` and `many_for_each_mut` to `Query`.
    These take a list of entities (Anything that implements `IntoIterator<Item: Borrow<Entity>>`).
    
    `iter_many` returns a `QueryManyIter` iterator over immutable results of a query (mutable data will be cast to an immutable form).
    
    `many_for_each_mut` calls a closure for every result of the query, ensuring not aliased mutability.
    This iterator goes over the list of entities in order and returns the result from the query for it. Skipping over any entities that don't match the query.
    
    Also added `unsafe fn iter_many_unsafe`.
    
    ### Examples
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct Counter {
        value: i32
    }
    
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct Friends {
        list: Vec<Entity>,
    }
    
    fn system(
        friends_query: Query<&Friends>,
        mut counter_query: Query<&mut Counter>,
    ) {
        for friends in &friends_query {
            for counter in counter_query.iter_many(&friends.list) {
                println!("Friend's counter: {:?}", counter.value);
            }
    
            counter_query.many_for_each_mut(&friends.list, |mut counter| {
                counter.value += 1;
                println!("Friend's counter: {:?}", counter.value);
            });
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    Here's how example in the Objective section can be written with this PR.
    ```rust
    fn system(foo_query: Query<(&Foo, &Children)>, bar_query: Query<(&Bar, &Children)>) {
        for (foo, children) in &foo_query {
            for (bar, children) in bar_query.iter_many(children) {
                for (foo, children) in foo_query.iter_many(children) {
                    // :D
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    ## Additional changes
    Implemented `IntoIterator` for `&Children` because why not.
    ## Todo
    - Bikeshed!

    diagnostics: meaningful error when graph node has wrong number of inputs (#4924)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, providing the wrong number of inputs to a render graph node triggers this assertion:
    
    ```
    thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
      left: `1`,
     right: `2`', /[redacted]/bevy/crates/bevy_render/src/renderer/graph_runner.rs:164:13
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    ```
    
    This does not provide the user any context.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a new `RenderGraphRunnerError` variant to handle this case. The new message looks like this:
    
    ```
    ERROR bevy_render::renderer: Error running render graph:
    ERROR bevy_render::renderer: > node (name: 'Some("outline_pass")') has 2 input slots, but was provided 1 values
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    `RenderGraphRunnerError` now has a new variant, `MismatchedInputCount`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Exhaustive matches on `RenderGraphRunnerError` will need to add a branch to handle the new `MismatchedInputCount` variant.

    Fix release workflow (#4903)
    
    # Objective
    
    While playing with the code, I found some problems in the recently merged version-bumping workflow:
    - Most importantly, now that we are using `0.8.0-dev` in development, the workflow will try to bump it to `0.9.0` :sob:
    - The crate filter is outdated now that we have more crates in `tools`.
    - We are using `bevy@users.noreply.github.com`, but according to [Github help](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#about-commit-email-addresses), that email address means "old no-reply email format for the user `bevy`". It is currently not associated with any account, but I feel this is still not appropriate here.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Create a new workflow, `Post-release version bump`, that should be run after a release and bumps version from `0.X.0` to `0.X+1.0-dev`. Unfortunately, cargo-release doesn't have a builtin way to do this, so we need to parse and increment the version manually.
    - Add the new crates in `tools` to exclusion list. Also removes the dependency version specifier from `bevy_ecs_compile_fail_tests`. It is not in the workspace so the dependency version will not get automatically updated by cargo-release.
    - Change the author email to `41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`. According to the discussion [here](https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/13#issuecomment-724415212) and [here](https://github.community/t/github-actions-bot-email-address/17204/6), this is the email address associated with the github-actions bot account.
    - Also add the workflows to our release checklist.
    
    See infmagic2047#5 and infmagic2047#6 for examples of release and post-release PRs.

    Camera Driven Viewports (#4898)
    
    # Objective
    
    Users should be able to render cameras to specific areas of a render target, which enables scenarios like split screen, minimaps, etc.
    
    Builds on the new Camera Driven Rendering added here: #4745
    Fixes: #202
    Alternative to #1389 and #3626 (which are incompatible with the new Camera Driven Rendering)
    
    ## Solution
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2694663/171560044-f0694f67-0cd9-4598-83e2-a9658c4fed57.png)
    
    
    Cameras can now configure an optional "viewport", which defines a rectangle within their render target to draw to. If a `Viewport` is defined, the camera's `CameraProjection`, `View`, and visibility calculations will use the viewport configuration instead of the full render target.
    
    ```rust
    // This camera will render to the first half of the primary window (on the left side).
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {
        camera: Camera {
            viewport: Some(Viewport {
                physical_position: UVec2::new(0, 0),
                physical_size: UVec2::new(window.physical_width() / 2, window.physical_height()),
                depth: 0.0..1.0,
            }),
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    });
    ```
    
    To account for this, the `Camera` component has received a few adjustments:
    
    * `Camera` now has some new getter functions:
      * `logical_viewport_size`, `physical_viewport_size`, `logical_target_size`, `physical_target_size`, `projection_matrix`
    *  All computed camera values are now private and live on the `ComputedCameraValues` field (logical/physical width/height, the projection matrix). They are now exposed on `Camera` via getters/setters  This wasn't _needed_ for viewports, but it was long overdue.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    * `Camera` components now have a `viewport` field, which can be set to draw to a portion of a render target instead of the full target.

    * Added a new split_screen example illustrating how to render two cameras to the same scene
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `Camera::projection_matrix` is no longer a public field. Use the new `Camera::projection_matrix()` method instead:
    
    ```rust
    
    // Bevy 0.7
    let projection = camera.projection_matrix;
    
    // Bevy 0.8
    let projection = camera.projection_matrix();
    ```

    Update commented vsync code in example to use present_mode (#4926)
    
    # Objective
    
    - To fix the broken commented code in `examples/shader/compute_shader_game_of_life.rs` for disabling frame throttling
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Change the commented code from using the old `WindowDescriptor::vsync` to the new `WindowDescriptor::present_mode`
    
    ### Note
    I chose to use the fully qualified scope `bevy::window::PresentWindow::Immediate` rather than explicitly including `PresentWindow` to avoid an unused import when the code is commented.

    Set naga capabilities corresponding to wgpu features (#4824)
    
    # Objective
    
    At the moment all extra capabilities are disabled when validating shaders with naga:
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c7c08f95cb784afc366eb2dcedd21d9d40e72d32/crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/shader.rs#L146-L149
    This means these features can't be used even if the corresponding wgpu features are active.
    
    ## Solution
    
    With these changes capabilities are now set corresponding to `RenderDevice::features`.
    
    ---
    
    I have validated these changes for push constants with a project I am currently working on. Though bevy does not support creating pipelines with push constants yet, so I was only able to see that shaders are validated and compiled as expected.

    Camera Driven Rendering (#4745)
    
    This adds "high level camera driven rendering" to Bevy. The goal is to give users more control over what gets rendered (and where) without needing to deal with render logic. This will make scenarios like "render to texture", "multiple windows", "split screen", "2d on 3d", "3d on 2d", "pass layering", and more significantly easier.
    
    Here is an [example of a 2d render sandwiched between two 3d renders (each from a different perspective)](https://gist.github.com/cart/4fe56874b2e53bc5594a182fc76f4915):
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2694663/168411086-af13dec8-0093-4a84-bdd4-d4362d850ffa.png)
    
    Users can now spawn a camera, point it at a RenderTarget (a texture or a window), and it will "just work".
    
    Rendering to a second window is as simple as spawning a second camera and assigning it to a specific window id:
    ```rust
    // main camera (main window)
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle::default());
    
    // second camera (other window)
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle {
        camera: Camera {
            target: RenderTarget::Window(window_id),
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    });
    ```
    
    Rendering to a texture is as simple as pointing the camera at a texture:
    
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle {
        camera: Camera {
            target: RenderTarget::Texture(image_handle),
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    });
    ```
    
    Cameras now have a "render priority", which controls the order they are drawn in. If you want to use a camera's output texture as a texture in the main pass, just set the priority to a number lower than the main pass camera (which defaults to `0`).
    
    ```rust
    // main pass camera with a default priority of 0
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle::default());
    
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle {
        camera: Camera {
            target: RenderTarget::Texture(image_handle.clone()),
            priority: -1,
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    });
    
    commands.spawn_bundle(SpriteBundle {
        texture: image_handle,
        ..default()
    })
    ```
    
    Priority can also be used to layer to cameras on top of each other for the same RenderTarget. This is what "2d on top of 3d" looks like in the new system:
    
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle::default());
    
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle {
        camera: Camera {
            // this will render 2d entities "on top" of the default 3d camera's render
            priority: 1,
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    });
    ```
    
    There is no longer the concept of a global "active camera". Resources like `ActiveCamera<Camera2d>` and `ActiveCamera<Camera3d>` have been replaced with the camera-specific `Camera::is_active` field. This does put the onus on users to manage which cameras should be active.
    
    Cameras are now assigned a single render graph as an "entry point", which is configured on each camera entity using the new `CameraRenderGraph` component. The old `PerspectiveCameraBundle` and `OrthographicCameraBundle` (generic on camera marker components like Camera2d and Camera3d) have been replaced by `Camera3dBundle` and `Camera2dBundle`, which set 3d and 2d default values for the `CameraRenderGraph` and projections.
    
    ```rust
    // old 3d perspective camera
    commands.spawn_bundle(PerspectiveCameraBundle::default())
    
    // new 3d perspective camera
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle::default())
    ```
    
    ```rust
    // old 2d orthographic camera
    commands.spawn_bundle(OrthographicCameraBundle::new_2d())
    
    // new 2d orthographic camera
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera2dBundle::default())
    ```
    
    ```rust
    // old 3d orthographic camera
    commands.spawn_bundle(OrthographicCameraBundle::new_3d())
    
    // new 3d orthographic camera
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {
        projection: OrthographicProjection {
            scale: 3.0,
            scaling_mode: ScalingMode::FixedVertical,
            ..default()
        }.into(),
        ..default()
    })
    ```
    
    Note that `Camera3dBundle` now uses a new `Projection` enum instead of hard coding the projection into the type. There are a number of motivators for this change: the render graph is now a part of the bundle, the way "generic bundles" work in the rust type system prevents nice `..default()` syntax, and changing projections at runtime is much easier with an enum (ex for editor scenarios). I'm open to discussing this choice, but I'm relatively certain we will all come to the same conclusion here. Camera2dBundle and Camera3dBundle are much clearer than being generic on marker components / using non-default constructors.
    
    If you want to run a custom render graph on a camera, just set the `CameraRenderGraph` component:
    
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {
        camera_render_graph: CameraRenderGraph::new(some_render_graph_name),
        ..default()
    })
    ```
    
    Just note that if the graph requires data from specific components to work (such as `Camera3d` config, which is provided in the `Camera3dBundle`), make sure the relevant components have been added.
    
    Speaking of using components to configure graphs / passes, there are a number of new configuration options:
    
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {
        camera_3d: Camera3d {
            // overrides the default global clear color
            clear_color: ClearColorConfig::Custom(Color::RED),
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    })
    
    commands.spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle {
        camera_3d: Camera3d {
            // disables clearing
            clear_color: ClearColorConfig::None,
            ..default()
        },
        ..default()
    })
    ```
    
    Expect to see more of the "graph configuration Components on Cameras" pattern in the future.
    
    By popular demand, UI no longer requires a dedicated camera. `UiCameraBundle` has been removed. `Camera2dBundle` and `Camera3dBundle` now both default to rendering UI as part of their own render graphs. To disable UI rendering for a camera, disable it using the CameraUi component:
    
    ```rust
    commands
        .spawn_bundle(Camera3dBundle::default())
        .insert(CameraUi {
            is_enabled: false,
            ..default()
        })
    ```
    
    ## Other Changes
    
    * The separate clear pass has been removed. We should revisit this for things like sky rendering, but I think this PR should "keep it simple" until we're ready to properly support that (for code complexity and performance reasons). We can come up with the right design for a modular clear pass in a followup pr.
    * I reorganized bevy_core_pipeline into Core2dPlugin and Core3dPlugin (and core_2d / core_3d modules). Everything is pretty much the same as before, just logically separate. I've moved relevant types (like Camera2d, Camera3d, Camera3dBundle, Camera2dBundle) into their relevant modules, which is what motivated this reorganization.
    * I adapted the `scene_viewer` example (which relied on the ActiveCameras behavior) to the new system. I also refactored bits and pieces to be a bit simpler.
    * All of the examples have been ported to the new camera approach. `render_to_texture` and `multiple_windows` are now _much_ simpler. I removed `two_passes` because it is less relevant with the new approach. If someone wants to add a new "layered custom pass with CameraRenderGraph" example, that might fill a similar niche. But I don't feel much pressure to add that in this pr.
    * Cameras now have `target_logical_size` and `target_physical_size` fields, which makes finding the size of a camera's render target _much_ simpler. As a result, the `Assets<Image>` and `Windows` parameters were removed from `Camera::world_to_screen`, making that operation much more ergonomic.
    * Render order ambiguities between cameras with the same target and the same priority now produce a warning. This accomplishes two goals:
        1. Now that there is no "global" active camera, by default spawning two cameras will result in two renders (one covering the other). This would be a silent performance killer that would be hard to detect after the fact. By detecting ambiguities, we can provide a helpful warning when this occurs.
        2. Render order ambiguities could result in unexpected / unpredictable render results. Resolving them makes sense.
    
    ## Follow Up Work
    
    * Per-Camera viewports, which will make it possible to render to a smaller area inside of a RenderTarget (great for something like splitscreen)
    * Camera-specific MSAA config (should use the same "overriding" pattern used for ClearColor)
    * Graph Based Camera Ordering: priorities are simple, but they make complicated ordering constraints harder to express. We should consider adopting a "graph based" camera ordering model with "before" and "after" relationships to other cameras (or build it "on top" of the priority system).
    * Consider allowing graphs to run subgraphs from any nest level (aka a global namespace for graphs). Right now the 2d and 3d graphs each need their own UI subgraph, which feels "fine" in the short term. But being able to share subgraphs between other subgraphs seems valuable.
    * Consider splitting `bevy_core_pipeline` into `bevy_core_2d` and `bevy_core_3d` packages. Theres a shared "clear color" dependency here, which would need a new home.

    Split mesh shader files (#4867)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Split PBR and 2D mesh shaders into types and bindings to prepare the shaders to be more reusable.
    - See #3969 for details. I'm doing this in multiple steps to make review easier.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Changed: 2D and PBR mesh shaders are now split into types and bindings, the following shader imports are available: `bevy_pbr::mesh_view_types`, `bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bindings`, `bevy_pbr::mesh_types`, `bevy_pbr::mesh_bindings`, `bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_types`, `bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_bindings`, `bevy_sprite::mesh2d_types`, `bevy_sprite::mesh2d_bindings`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - In shaders for 3D meshes:
      - `#import bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bind_group` -> `#import bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bindings`
      - `#import bevy_pbr::mesh_struct` -> `#import bevy_pbr::mesh_types`
        - NOTE: If you are using the mesh bind group at bind group index 2, you can remove those binding statements in your shader and just use `#import bevy_pbr::mesh_bindings` which itself imports the mesh types needed for the bindings.
    - In shaders for 2D meshes:
      - `#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_bind_group` -> `#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_bindings`
      - `#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_struct` -> `#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_types`
        - NOTE: If you are using the mesh2d bind group at bind group index 2, you can remove those binding statements in your shader and just use `#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_bindings` which itself imports the mesh2d types needed for the bindings.

    Generate vertex tangents using mikktspace (#3872)
    
    # Objective
    
    Models can be produced that do not have vertex tangents but do have normal map textures. The tangents can be generated. There is a way that the vertex tangents can be generated to be exactly invertible to avoid introducing error when recreating the normals in the fragment shader.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - After attempts to get https://github.com/gltf-rs/mikktspace to integrate simple glam changes and version bumps, and releases of that crate taking weeks / not being made (no offense intended to the authors/maintainers, bevy just has its own timelines and needs to take care of) it was decided to fork that repository. The following steps were taken:
      - mikktspace was forked to https://github.com/bevyengine/mikktspace in order to preserve the repository's history in case the original is ever taken down
      - The README in that repo was edited to add a note stating from where the repository was forked and explaining why
      - The repo was locked for changes as its only purpose is historical
      - The repo was integrated into the bevy repo using `git subtree add --prefix crates/bevy_mikktspace git@github.com:bevyengine/mikktspace.git master`
      - In `bevy_mikktspace`:
        - The travis configuration was removed
        - `cargo fmt` was run
        - The `Cargo.toml` was conformed to bevy's (just adding bevy to the keywords, changing the homepage and repository, changing the version to 0.7.0-dev - importantly the license is exactly the same)
        - Remove the features, remove `nalgebra` entirely, only use `glam`, suppress clippy.
          - This was necessary because our CI runs clippy with `--all-features` and the `nalgebra` and `glam` features are mutually exclusive, plus I don't want to modify this highly numerically-sensitive code just to appease clippy and diverge even more from upstream.
    - Rebase https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1795
      - @jakobhellermann said it was fine to copy and paste but it ended up being almost exactly the same with just a couple of adjustments when validating correctness so I decided to actually rebase it and then build on top of it.
    - Use the exact same fragment shader code to ensure correct normal mapping.
    - Tested with both https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/NormalTangentMirrorTest which has vertex tangents and https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/NormalTangentTest which requires vertex tangent generation

    Make ScalingMode more flexible (#3253)
    
    Adds ability to specify scaling factor for `WindowSize`, size of the fixed axis for `FixedVertical` and `FixedHorizontal` and a new `ScalingMode` that is a mix of `FixedVertical` and `FixedHorizontal`
    
    # The issue
    
    Currently, only available options are to:
    
    * Have one of the axes fixed to value 1
    * Have viewport size match the window size
    * Manually adjust viewport size
    
    In most of the games these options are not enough and more advanced scaling methods have to be used
    
    ## Solution
    
    The solution is to provide additional parameters to current scaling modes, like scaling factor for `WindowSize`. Additionally, a more advanced `Auto` mode is added, which dynamically switches between behaving like `FixedVertical` and `FixedHorizontal` depending on the window's aspect ratio.

    Clippy improvements (#4665)
    
    # Objective
    
    Follow up to my previous MR #3718 to add new clippy warnings to bevy:
    
    - [x] [~~option_if_let_else~~](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#option_if_let_else) (reverted)
    - [x] [redundant_else](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#redundant_else)

    - [x] [map_flatten](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/#map_flatten)
    
    There is one commit per clippy warning, and the matching flags are added to the CI execution.
    
    To test the CI execution you may run `cargo run -p ci -- clippy` at the root.
    
    I choose the add the flags in the `ci` tool crate to avoid having them in every `lib.rs` but I guess it could become an issue with suprise warnings coming up after a commit/push

    Improve soundness of `CommandQueue` (#4863)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR aims to improve the soundness of `CommandQueue`. In particular it aims to:
    - make it sound to store commands that contain padding or uninitialized bytes;
    - avoid uses of commands after moving them in the queue's buffer (`std::mem::forget` is technically a use of its argument);
    - remove useless checks: `self.bytes.as_mut_ptr().is_null()` is always `false` because even `Vec`s that haven't allocated use a dangling pointer. Moreover the same pointer was used to write the command, so it ought to be valid for reads if it was for writes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - To soundly store padding or uninitialized bytes `CommandQueue` was changed to contain a `Vec<MaybeUninit<u8>>` instead of `Vec<u8>`;
    - To avoid uses of the command through `std::mem::forget`, `ManuallyDrop` was used.
    
    ## Other observations
    
    While writing this PR I noticed that `CommandQueue` doesn't seem to drop the commands that weren't applied. While this is a pretty niche case (you would have to be manually using `CommandQueue`/`std::mem::swap`ping one), I wonder if it should be documented anyway.

    Make bug template more beginner-friendly (#4652)
    
    # Objective
    
    1. "What you expected to happen" and "what actually happened" often involves trivial duplication.
    2. "Please provide full reproduction steps" is not helpful advice to new contributors.
    3. The OS field was commonly useless or inadequate.
    4. The description for "additional information" effectively just repeated the title of the field.
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. Unify these fields into a single "what went wrong" field.
    2. Provide an example of a useful reproduction.
    3. Replace OS field with an optional "Setup Information" field that captures information about other critical setup like Rust version and hardware.
    4. Provide helpful advice about what sort of information may be useful to add.

    remove `Serialize` impl for dyn Array and friends (#4780)
    
    # Objective
    
    `bevy_reflect` as different kinds of reflected types (each with their own trait), `trait Struct: Reflect`, `trait List: Reflect`, `trait Map: Reflect`, ...
    Types that don't fit either of those are called reflect value types, they are opaque and can't be deconstructed further.
    
    `bevy_reflect` can serialize `dyn Reflect` values. Any container types (struct, list, map) get deconstructed and their elements serialized separately, which can all happen without serde being involved ever (happens [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_reflect/src/serde/ser.rs#L50-L85=)).
     The only point at which we require types to be serde-serializable is for *value types* (happens [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_reflect/src/serde/ser.rs#L104=)).
    
    So reflect array serializing is solved, since arrays are container types which don't require serde.
    
    #1213 also introduced added the `serialize` method and `Serialize` impls for `dyn Array` and `DynamicArray` which use their element's `Reflect::serializable` function. This is 1. unnecessary, because it is not used for array serialization, and 2. annoying for removing the `Serialize` bound on container types, because these impls don't have access to the `TypeRegistry`, so we can't move the serialization code there.
    
    # Solution
    
    Remove these impls and `fn serialize`. It's not used and annoying for other changes.

    scene_viewer: Make it possible to disable the animation feature (#4849)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The `scene_viewer` example assumes the `animation` feature is enabled, which it is by default. However, animations may have a performance cost that is undesirable when testing performance, for example. Then it is useful to be able to disable the `animation` feature and one would still like the `scene_viewer` example to work.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Gate animation code in `scene_viewer` on the `animation` feature being enabled.

    # Objective
    Increase compatibility with a fairly common format of padded spritesheets, in which half the padding value occurs before the first sprite box begins. The original behaviour falls out when `Vec2::ZERO` is used for `offset`.

    ## Solution
    Tiny change to `crates/bevy_sprite/src/texture_atlas.rs`

    from_grid_with_padding(texture, tile_size, columns, rows, padding)

    bevy_reflect: Add `#[reflect(default)]` attribute for `FromReflect` (#4140)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, `FromReflect` makes a couple assumptions:
    
    * Ignored fields must implement `Default`
    * Active fields must implement `FromReflect`
    * The reflected must be fully populated for active fields (can't use an empty `DynamicStruct`)
    
    However, one or both of these requirements might be unachievable, such as for external types. In these cases, it might be nice to tell `FromReflect` to use a custom default.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added the `#[reflect(default)]` derive helper attribute. This attribute can be applied to any field (ignored or not) and will allow a default value to be specified in place of the regular `from_reflect()` call.
    
    It takes two forms: `#[reflect(default)]` and `#[reflect(default = "some_func")]`. The former specifies that `Default::default()` should be used while the latter specifies that `some_func()` should be used. This is pretty much [how serde does it](https://serde.rs/field-attrs.html#default).
    
    ### Example
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]
    struct MyStruct {
      // Use `Default::default()`
      #[reflect(default)]
      foo: String,
    
      // Use `get_bar_default()`
      #[reflect(default = "get_bar_default")]
      #[reflect(ignore)]
      bar: usize,
    }
    
    fn get_bar_default() -> usize {
      123
    }
    ```
    
    ### Active Fields
    
    As an added benefit, this also allows active fields to be completely missing from their dynamic object. This is because the attribute tells `FromReflect` how to handle missing active fields (it still tries to use `from_reflect` first so the `FromReflect` trait is still required).
    
    ```rust
    let dyn_struct = DynamicStruct::default();
    
    // We can do this without actually including the active fields since they have `#[reflect(default)]`
    let my_struct = <MyStruct as FromReflect>::from_reflect(&dyn_struct);
    ```
    
    ### Container Defaults
    
    Also, with the addition of #3733, people will likely start adding `#[reflect(Default)]` to their types now. Just like with the fields, we can use this to mark the entire container as "defaultable". This grants us the ability to completely remove the field markers altogether if our type implements `Default` (and we're okay with fields using that instead of their own `Default` impls):
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect, FromReflect)]
    #[reflect(Default)]
    struct MyStruct {
      foo: String,
      #[reflect(ignore)]
      bar: usize,
    }
    
    impl Default for MyStruct {
      fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
          foo: String::from("Hello"),
          bar: 123,
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Again, we can now construct this from nothing pretty much
    let dyn_struct = DynamicStruct::default();
    let my_struct = <MyStruct as FromReflect>::from_reflect(&dyn_struct);
    ```
    
    Now if _any_ field is missing when using `FromReflect`, we simply fallback onto the container's `Default` implementation.
    
    This behavior can be completely overridden on a per-field basis, of course, by simply defining those same field attributes like before.

    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Added `#[reflect(default)]` field attribute for `FromReflect`
      * Allows missing fields to be given a default value when using `FromReflect`
      * `#[reflect(default)]` - Use the field's `Default` implementation
      * `#[reflect(default = "some_fn")]` - Use a custom function to get the default value
    * Allow `#[reflect(Default)]` to have a secondary usage as a container attribute
      * Allows missing fields to be given a default value based on the container's `Default` impl when using `FromReflect`

    ExtractResourcePlugin (#3745)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add an `ExtractResourcePlugin` for convenience and consistency
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add an `ExtractResourcePlugin` similar to `ExtractComponentPlugin` but for ECS `Resource`s. The system that is executed simply clones the main world resource into a render world resource, if and only if the main world resource was either added or changed since the last execution of the system.
    - Add an `ExtractResource` trait with a `fn extract_resource(res: &Self) -> Self` function. This is used by the `ExtractResourcePlugin` to extract the resource
    - Add a derive macro for `ExtractResource` on a `Resource` with the `Clone` trait, that simply returns `res.clone()`
    - Use `ExtractResourcePlugin` wherever both possible and appropriate

    Allow higher order systems (#4833)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Higher order system could not be created by users.
    - However, a simple change to `SystemParamFunction` allows this.
    - Higher order systems in this case mean functions which return systems created using other systems, such as `chain` (which is basically equivalent to map)
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Change `SystemParamFunction` to be a safe abstraction over `FnMut([In<In>,] ...params)->Out`.
    - Note that I believe `SystemParamFunction` should not have been counted as part of our public api before this PR.
        - This is because its only use was an unsafe function without an actionable safety comment.
        - The safety comment was basically 'call this within bevy code'.
        - I also believe that there are no external users in its current form.
            - A quick search on Google and in the discord confirmed this.

    Enforce type safe usage of Handle::get (#4794)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Sometimes, people might load an asset as one type, then use it with an `Asset`s for a different type.
    - See e.g. #4784.
    - This is especially likely with the Gltf types, since users may not have a clear conceptual model of what types the assets will be.
    - We had an instance of this ourselves, in the `scene_viewer` example
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make `Assets::get` require a type safe handle.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - `Assets::<T>::get` and `Assets::<T>::get_mut` now require that the passed handles are `Handle<T>`, improving the type safety of handles.
    
    ### Added
    - `HandleUntyped::typed_weak`, a helper function for creating a weak typed version of an exisitng `HandleUntyped`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `Assets::<T>::get` and `Assets::<T>::get_mut` now require that the passed handles are `Handle<T>`, improving the type safety of handles. If you were previously passing in:
       - a `HandleId`, use `&Handle::weak(id)` instead, to create a weak handle. You may have been able to store a type safe `Handle` instead.
       - a `HandleUntyped`, use `&handle_untyped.typed_weak()` to create a weak handle of the specified type. This is most likely to be the useful when using [load_folder](https://docs.rs/bevy_asset/latest/bevy_asset/struct.AssetServer.html#method.load_folder)
       - a `Handle<U>` of  of a different type, consider whether this is the correct handle type to store. If it is (i.e. the same handle id is used for multiple different Asset types) use `Handle::weak(handle.id)` to cast to a different type.

    Copy TaskPool resoures to subapps (#4792)
    
    # Objective
    Fixes #4791. `ParallelExecutor` inserts a default `CompteTaskPool` if there isn't one stored as a resource, including when it runs on a different world. When spawning the render sub-app, the main world's `ComputeTaskPool` is not cloned and inserted into the render app's, which causes a second `ComputeTaskPool` with the default configuration to be spawned. This results in an excess number of threads being spawned.
    
    ## Solution
    Copy the task pools from the main world to the subapps upon creating them.
    
    ## Alternative
    An alternative to this would be to make the task pools global, as seen in #2250 or bevyengine/rfcs#54.

    Use u32 over usize for ComponentSparseSet indicies (#4723)
    
    # Objective
    Use less memory to store SparseSet components.
    
    ## Solution
    Change `ComponentSparseSet` to only use `Entity::id` in it's key internally, and change the usize value in it's SparseArray to use u32 instead, as it cannot have more than u32::MAX live entities stored at once.
    
    This should reduce the overhead of storing components in sparse set storage by 50%.

    Remove task_pool parameter from par_for_each(_mut) (#4705)
    
    # Objective
    Fixes #3183. Requiring a `&TaskPool` parameter is sort of meaningless if the only correct one is to use the one provided by `Res<ComputeTaskPool>` all the time.
    
    ## Solution
    Have `QueryState` save a clone of the `ComputeTaskPool` which is used for all `par_for_each` functions.
    
    ~~Adds a small overhead of the internal `Arc` clone as a part of the startup, but the ergonomics win should be well worth this hardly-noticable overhead.~~
    
    Updated the docs to note that it will panic the task pool is not present as a resource.
    
    # Future Work
    If https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/54 is approved, we can replace these resource lookups with a static function call instead to get the `ComputeTaskPool`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Removed: The `task_pool` parameter of `Query(State)::par_for_each(_mut)`. These calls will use the `World`'s `ComputeTaskPool` resource instead.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    The `task_pool` parameter for `Query(State)::par_for_each(_mut)` has been removed. Remove these parameters from all calls to these functions.
    
    Before:
    ```rust
    fn parallel_system(
       task_pool: Res<ComputeTaskPool>,
       query: Query<&MyComponent>,
    ) {
       query.par_for_each(&task_pool, 32, |comp| {
            ...
       });
    }
    ```
    
    After:
    
    ```rust
    fn parallel_system(query: Query<&MyComponent>) {
       query.par_for_each(32, |comp| {
            ...
       });
    }
    ```
    
    If using `Query(State)` outside of a system run by the scheduler, you may need to manually configure and initialize a `ComputeTaskPool` as a resource in the `World`.

    # Objective
    The `ComponentId` in `Column` is redundant as it's stored in parallel in the surrounding `SparseSet` all the time.

    bevy_reflect: Improve debug formatting for reflected types (#4218)
    
    # Objective
    
    Debugging reflected types can be somewhat frustrating since all `dyn Reflect` trait objects return something like `Reflect(core::option::Option<alloc::string::String>)`.
    
    It would be much nicer to be able to see the actual value— or even use a custom `Debug` implementation.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added `Reflect::debug` which allows users to customize the debug output. It sets defaults for all `ReflectRef` subtraits and falls back to `Reflect(type_name)` if no `Debug` implementation was registered.
    
    To register a custom `Debug` impl, users can add `#[reflect(Debug)]` like they can with other traits.
    
    ### Example
    
    Using the following structs:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    pub struct Foo {
        a: usize,
        nested: Bar,
        #[reflect(ignore)]
        _ignored: NonReflectedValue,
    }
    
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    pub struct Bar {
        value: Vec2,
        tuple_value: (i32, String),
        list_value: Vec<usize>,
        // We can't determine debug formatting for Option<T> yet
        unknown_value: Option<String>,
        custom_debug: CustomDebug
    }
    
    #[derive(Reflect)]
    #[reflect(Debug)]
    struct CustomDebug;
    
    impl Debug for CustomDebug {
        fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
            write!(f, "This is a custom debug!")
        }
    }
    
    pub struct NonReflectedValue {
        _a: usize,
    }
    ```
    
    We can do:
    
    ```rust
    let value = Foo {
      a: 1,
      _ignored: NonReflectedValue { _a: 10 },
      nested: Bar {
        value: Vec2::new(1.23, 3.21),
        tuple_value: (123, String::from("Hello")),
        list_value: vec![1, 2, 3],
        unknown_value: Some(String::from("World")),
        custom_debug: CustomDebug
      },
    };
    let reflected_value: &dyn Reflect = &value;
    println!("{:#?}", reflected_value)
    ```
    
    Which results in:
    
    ```rust
    Foo {
      a: 2,
      nested: Bar {
        value: Vec2(
          1.23,
          3.21,
        ),
        tuple_value: (
          123,
          "Hello",
        ),
        list_value: [
          1,
          2,
          3,
        ],
        unknown_value: Reflect(core::option::Option<alloc::string::String>),
        custom_debug: This is a custom debug!,
      },
    }
    ```
    
    Notice that neither `Foo` nor `Bar` implement `Debug`, yet we can still deduce it. This might be a concern if we're worried about leaking internal values. If it is, we might want to consider a way to exclude fields (possibly with a `#[reflect(hide)]` macro) or make it purely opt in (as opposed to the default implementation automatically handled by ReflectRef subtraits).

    untyped APIs for components and resources (#4447)
    
    # Objective
    
    Even if bevy itself does not provide any builtin scripting or modding APIs, it should have the foundations for building them yourself.
    For that it should be enough to have APIs that are not tied to the actual rust types with generics, but rather accept `ComponentId`s and `bevy_ptr` ptrs.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add the following APIs to bevy
    ```rust
    fn EntityRef::get_by_id(ComponentId) -> Option<Ptr<'w>>;
    fn EntityMut::get_by_id(ComponentId) -> Option<Ptr<'_>>;
    fn EntityMut::get_mut_by_id(ComponentId) -> Option<MutUntyped<'_>>;
    
    fn World::get_resource_by_id(ComponentId) -> Option<Ptr<'_>>;
    fn World::get_resource_mut_by_id(ComponentId) -> Option<MutUntyped<'_>>;
    
    // Safety: `value` must point to a valid value of the component
    unsafe fn World::insert_resource_by_id(ComponentId, value: OwningPtr);
    
    fn ComponentDescriptor::new_with_layout(..) -> Self;
    fn World::init_component_with_descriptor(ComponentDescriptor) -> ComponentId;
    ```
    
    ~~This PR would definitely benefit from #3001 (lifetime'd pointers) to make sure that the lifetimes of the pointers are valid and the my-move pointer in `insert_resource_by_id` could be an `OwningPtr`, but that can be adapter later if/when #3001 is merged.~~
    
    ### Not in this PR
    - inserting components on entities (this is very tied to types with bundles and the `BundleInserter`)
    - an untyped version of a query (needs good API design, has a large implementation complexity, can be done in a third-party crate)

    OrthographicProjection: place origin at integer pixel with WindowSize scaling mode (#4085)
    
    # Objective
    
    One way to avoid texture atlas bleeding is to ensure that every vertex is
    placed at an integer pixel coordinate. This is a particularly appealing
    solution for regular structures like tile maps.
    
    Doing so is currently harder than necessary when the WindowSize scaling
    mode and Center origin are used: For odd window width or height, the
    origin of the coordinate system is placed in the middle of a pixel at
    some .5 offset.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Avoid this issue by rounding the half width and height values.

    Make bevy_app's optional bevy_reflect dependency actually optional (#4846)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make bevy_app's optional bevy_reflect dependency actually optional
    - Because bevy_ecs has a default dependency on bevy_reflect, bevy_app includes bevy_reflect transitively even with default-features=false, despite the optional dependency indicating that it was intended to be able to leave out bevy_reflect.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make bevy_app not enable bevy_ecs's default features, and then use [the `dep:` syntax](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#optional-dependencies) introduced in 1.60 to make the default bevy_reflect feature enable bevy_ecs's bevy_reflect feature/dependency.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - bevy_app no longer enables bevy_ecs's `bevy_reflect` feature when included without its own `bevy_reflect` feature (which is on by default).

    Split time functionality into bevy_time (#4187)
    
    # Objective
    
    Reduce the catch-all grab-bag of functionality in bevy_core by minimally splitting off time functionality into bevy_time. Functionality like that provided by #3002 would increase the complexity of bevy_time, so this is a good candidate for pulling into its own unit.
    
    A step in addressing #2931 and splitting bevy_core into more specific locations.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Pull the time module of bevy_core into a new crate, bevy_time.
    
    # Migration guide
    
    - Time related types (e.g. `Time`, `Timer`, `Stopwatch`, `FixedTimestep`, etc.) should be imported from `bevy::time::*` rather than `bevy::core::*`.
    - If you were adding `CorePlugin` manually, you'll also want to add `TimePlugin` from `bevy::time`.
    - The `bevy::core::CorePlugin::Time` system label is replaced with `bevy::time::TimeSystem`.

    Improve docs and naming for RawWindowHandle functionality (#4335)
    
    # Objective
    
    - As noticed in #4333 by @x-52, the exact purpose and logic of `HasRawWIndowHandleWrapper` is unclear
    - Unfortunately, there are rather good reasons why this design is needed (and why we can't just `impl HasRawWindowHandle for RawWindowHandleWrapper`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Rename `HasRawWindowHandleWrapper` to `ThreadLockedRawWindowHandleWrapper`, reflecting the primary distinction
    - Document how this design is intended to be used
    - Leave comments explaining why this design must exist

    Optionally resize Window canvas element to fit parent element (#4726)
    
    Currently Bevy's web canvases are "fixed size". They are manually set to specific dimensions. This might be fine for some games and website layouts, but for sites with flexible layouts, or games that want to "fill" the browser window, Bevy doesn't provide the tools needed to make this easy out of the box.
    
    There are third party plugins like [bevy-web-resizer](https://github.com/frewsxcv/bevy-web-resizer/) that listen for window resizes, take the new dimensions, and resize the winit window accordingly. However this only covers a subset of cases and this is common enough functionality that it should be baked into Bevy.
    
    A significant motivating use case here is the [Bevy WASM Examples page](https://bevyengine.org/examples/). This scales the canvas to fit smaller windows (such as mobile). But this approach both breaks winit's mouse events and removes pixel-perfect rendering (which means we might be rendering too many or too few pixels).  https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/issues/371
    
    In an ideal world, winit would support this behavior out of the box. But unfortunately that seems blocked for now: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2074. And it builds on the ResizeObserver api, which isn't supported in all browsers yet (and is only supported in very new versions of the popular browsers).
    
    While we wait for a complete winit solution, I've added a `fit_canvas_to_parent` option to WindowDescriptor / Window, which when enabled will listen for window resizes and resize the Bevy canvas/window to fit its parent element. This enables users to scale bevy canvases using arbitrary CSS, by "inheriting" their parents' size. Note that the wrapper element _is_ required because winit overrides the canvas sizing with absolute values on each resize.
    
    There is one limitation worth calling out here: while the majority of  canvas resizes will be triggered by window resizes, modifying element layout at runtime (css animations, javascript-driven element changes, dev-tool-injected changes, etc) will not be detected here. I'm not aware of a good / efficient event-driven way to do this outside of the ResizeObserver api. In practice, window-resize-driven canvas resizing should cover the majority of use cases. Users that want to actively poll for element resizes can just do that (or we can build another feature and let people choose based on their specific needs).
    
    I also took the chance to make a couple of minor tweaks:
    * Made the `canvas` window setting available on all platforms. Users shouldn't need to deal with cargo feature selection to support web scenarios. We can just ignore the value on non-web platforms. I added documentation that explains this.
    *  Removed the redundant "initial create windows" handler. With the addition of the code in this pr, the code duplication was untenable.
    
    This enables a number of patterns:
    
    ## Easy "fullscreen window" mode for the default canvas
    
    The "parent element" defaults to the `<body>` element.
    
    ```rust
    app
      .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {
        fit_canvas_to_parent: true,
        ..default()
      })
    ```
    And CSS:
    ```css
    html, body {
        margin: 0;
        height: 100%;
    }
    ```
    
    ## Fit custom canvas to "wrapper" parent element
    
    ```rust
    app
      .insert_resource(WindowDescriptor {
        fit_canvas_to_parent: true,
        canvas: Some("#bevy".to_string()),
        ..default()
      })
    ```
    And the HTML:
    ```html
    <div style="width: 50%; height: 100%">
      <canvas id="bevy"></canvas>
    </div>
    ```

    Fix unsoundness with `Or`/`AnyOf`/`Option` component access' (#4659)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #4657
    
    Example code that wasnt panic'ing before this PR (and so was unsound):
    ```rust
        #[test]
        #[should_panic = "error[B0001]"]
        fn option_has_no_filter_with() {
            fn sys(_1: Query<(Option<&A>, &mut B)>, _2: Query<&mut B, Without<A>>) {}
            let mut world = World::default();
            run_system(&mut world, sys);
        }
    
        #[test]
        #[should_panic = "error[B0001]"]
        fn any_of_has_no_filter_with() {
            fn sys(_1: Query<(AnyOf<(&A, ())>, &mut B)>, _2: Query<&mut B, Without<A>>) {}
            let mut world = World::default();
            run_system(&mut world, sys);
        }
    
        #[test]
        #[should_panic = "error[B0001]"]
        fn or_has_no_filter_with() {
            fn sys(_1: Query<&mut B, Or<(With<A>, With<B>)>>, _2: Query<&mut B, Without<A>>) {}
            let mut world = World::default();
            run_system(&mut world, sys);
        }
    ```
    ## Solution
    
    - Only add the intersection of `with`/`without` accesses of all the elements in `Or/AnyOf` to the world query's `FilteredAccess<ComponentId>` instead of the union.
    - `Option`'s fix can be thought of the same way since its basically `AnyOf<T, ()>` but its impl is just simpler as `()` has no `with`/`without` accesses
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - `Or`/`AnyOf`/`Option` will now report more query conflicts in order to fix unsoundness
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - If you are now getting query conflicts from `Or`/`AnyOf`/`Option` rip to you and ur welcome for it now being caught

    Reduce code duplication by using QueryIterationCursor in QueryIter (#4733)
    
    # Objective
    We have duplicated code between `QueryIter` and `QueryIterationCursor`. Reuse that code.
    
    ## Solution
     - Reuse `QueryIterationCursor` inside `QueryIter`.
     - Slim down `QueryIter` by removing the `&'w World`. It was only being used by the `size_hint` and `ExactSizeIterator` impls, which can use the QueryState and &Archetypes in the type already.
     - Benchmark to make sure there is no significant regression.
    
    Relevant benchmark results seem to show that there is no tangible difference between the two. Everything seems to be either identical or within a workable margin of error here.

    bevy_reflect: Small refactor and default `Reflect` methods (#4739)
    
    # Objective
    
    Quick followup to #4712.
    
    While updating some [other PRs](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4218), I realized the `ReflectTraits` struct could be improved. The issue with the current implementation is that `ReflectTraits::get_xxx_impl(...)` returns just the _logic_ to the corresponding `Reflect` trait method, rather than the entire function.
    
    This makes it slightly more annoying to manage since the variable names need to be consistent across files. For example, `get_partial_eq_impl` uses a `value` variable. But the name "value" isn't defined in the `get_partial_eq_impl` method, it's defined in three other methods in a completely separate file.
    
    It's not likely to cause any bugs if we keep it as it is since differing variable names will probably just result in a compile error (except in very particular cases). But it would be useful to someone who wanted to edit/add/remove a method.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Made `get_hash_impl`, `get_partial_eq_impl` and `get_serialize_impl` return the entire method implementation for `reflect_hash`, `reflect_partial_eq`, and `serializable`, respectively.
    
    As a result of this, those three `Reflect` methods were also given default implementations. This was fairly simple to do since all three could just be made to return `None`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Small cleanup/refactor to `ReflectTraits` in `bevy_reflect_derive`
    * Gave `Reflect::reflect_hash`, `Reflect::reflect_partial_eq`, and `Reflect::serializable` default implementations

    Skip `drop` when `needs_drop` is `false` (#4773)
    
    # Objective
    
    - We do a lot of function pointer calls in a hot loop (clearing entities in render). This is slow, since calling function pointers cannot be optimised out. We can avoid that in the cases where the function call is a no-op.
    - Alternative to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2897
    - On my machine, in `many_cubes`, this reduces dropping time from ~150μs to ~80μs.
    
    ## Solution
    -  Make `drop` in `BlobVec` an `Option`, recording whether the given drop impl is required or not.
    - Note that this does add branching in some cases - we could consider splitting this into two fields, i.e. unconditionally call the `drop` fn pointer.
    - My intuition of how often types stored in `World` should have non-trivial drops makes me think that would be slower, however.
    
    N.B. Even once this lands, we should still test having a 'drop_multiple' variant - for types with a real `Drop` impl, the current implementation is definitely optimal.

    bench: add `bevy_reflect::{List, Map, Struct}` benchmarks (#3690)
    
    # Objective
    
    Partially addresses #3594.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This adds basic benchmarks for `List`, `Map`, and `Struct` implementors, both concrete (`Vec`, `HashMap`, and defined struct types) and dynamic (`DynamicList`, `DynamicMap` and `DynamicStruct`).
    
    A few insights from the benchmarks (all measurements are local on my machine):
    - Applying a list with many elements to a list with no elements is slower than applying to a list of the same length:
      - 3-4x slower when applying to a `Vec`
      - 5-6x slower when applying to a `DynamicList`
    
      I suspect this could be improved by `reserve()`ing the correct length up front, but haven't tested.
    - Applying a `DynamicMap` to another `Map` is linear in the number of elements, but applying a `HashMap` seems to be at least quadratic. No intuition on this one.
    - Applying like structs (concrete -> concrete, `DynamicStruct` -> `DynamicStruct`) seems to be faster than applying unlike structs.

    Fix frame count being a float (#4493)
    
    Original reasoning: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/678#issuecomment-930602773
    
    That reasoning doesn't seem valid IMO since eventually +1 will do nothing. Using an integer is more intuitive and will wrap around which is probably better than getting stuck.

    Ensure that the parent is always the expected entity (#4717)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Transform propogation could stack overflow when there was a cycle.
    - I think https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4203 would use all available memory.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make sure that the child entity's `Parent`s are their parents.
    
    This is also required for when parallelising, although as noted in the comment, the naïve solution would be UB.
    (The best way to fix this would probably be an `&mut UnsafeCell<T>` `WorldQuery`, or wrapper type with the same effect)

    bevy_ptr works in no_std environments (#4760)
    
    # Objective
    `bevy_ptr` works just fine without `std`. Mark it as `no_std`. This should generally be useful for non-bevy use cases, but it also marginally speeds up compilation by allowing the crate to compile without loading the std-lib.
    
    ## Solution
    Replace `std` with `core`. Added `#![no_std]` to the crate and to the crate's tags.
    
    Also added a missing `#![warn(missing_docs)]` that the other crates have.

    - Removed the `ClusterFarZMode::CameraFarPlane` far z mode.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Cameras no longer accept near and far values during initialization
    - `ClusterFarZMode::Constant` should be used with the far value instead of `ClusterFarZMode::CameraFarPlane`

    Doc/module style doc blocks for examples (#4438)
    
    # Objective
    
    Provide a starting point for #3951, or a partial solution.
    Providing a few comment blocks to discuss, and hopefully find better one in the process.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Since I am pretty new to pretty much anything in this context, I figured I'd just start with a draft for some file level doc blocks. For some of them I found more relevant details (or at least things I considered interessting), for some others there is less.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Moved some existing comments from main() functions in the 2d examples to the file header level
    - Wrote some more comment blocks for most other 2d examples
    
    TODO:
    - [x] 2d/sprite_sheet, wasnt able to come up with something good yet
    - [x] all other example groups...
    
    
    Also: Please let me know if the commit style is okay, or to verbose. I could certainly squash these things, or add more details if needed.
    I also hope its okay to raise this PR this early, with just a few files changed. Took me long enough and I dont wanted to let it go to waste because I lost motivation to do the whole thing. Additionally I am somewhat uncertain over the style and contents of the commets. So let me know what you thing please.

    Fail to compile on 16-bit platforms (#4736)
    
    # Objective
    `bevy_ecs` assumes that `u32 as usize` is a lossless operation and in a few cases relies on this for soundness and correctness. The only platforms that Rust compiles to where this invariant is broken are 16-bit systems.
    
    A very clear example of this behavior is in the SparseSetIndex impl for Entity, where it converts a u32 into a usize to act as an index. If usize is 16-bit, the conversion will overflow and provide the caller with the wrong index. This can easily result in previously unforseen aliased mutable borrows (i.e. Query::get_many_mut).
    
    ## Solution
    Explicitly fail compilation on 16-bit platforms instead of introducing UB.
    
    Properly supporting 16-bit systems will likely need a workable use case first.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    Removed: Ability to compile `bevy_ecs` on 16-bit platforms.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    `bevy_ecs` will now explicitly fail to compile on 16-bit platforms.  If this is required, there is currently no alternative. Please file an issue (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) to help detail your use case.

    bevy_reflect: Reflect arrays (#4701)
    
    # Objective
    
    > ℹ️ **Note**: This is a rebased version of #2383. A large portion of it has not been touched (only a few minor changes) so that any additional discussion may happen here. All credit should go to @NathanSWard for their work on the original PR.
    
    - Currently reflection is not supported for arrays.
    - Fixes #1213
    
    ## Solution
    
    * Implement reflection for arrays via the `Array` trait.
    * Note, `Array` is different from `List` in the way that you cannot push elements onto an array as they are statically sized.
    * Now `List` is defined as a sub-trait of `Array`.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * Added the `Array` reflection trait
    * Allows arrays up to length 32 to be reflected via the `Array` trait
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    * The `List` trait now has the `Array` supertrait. This means that `clone_dynamic` will need to specify which version to use:
      ```rust
      // Before
      let cloned = my_list.clone_dynamic();
      // After
      let cloned = List::clone_dynamic(&my_list);
      ```
    * All implementers of `List` will now need to implement `Array` (this mostly involves moving the existing methods to the `Array` impl)

    Add a clear() method to the EventReader that consumes the iterator (#4693)
    
    # Objective
    
    - It's pretty common to want to check if an EventReader has received one or multiple events while also needing to consume the iterator to "clear" the EventReader.
    - The current approach is to do something like `events.iter().count() > 0` or `events.iter().last().is_some()`. It's not immediately obvious that the purpose of that is to consume the events and check if there were any events. My solution doesn't really solve that part, but it encapsulates the pattern.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `.clear()` method that consumes the iterator.
            - It takes the EventReader by value to make sure it isn't used again after it has been called.
    
    ---
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Not a breaking change, but if you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to consume the EventReader and check if there was any events you can now use
    
    ```rust
    fn system(events: EventReader<MyEvent>) {
            if !events.is_empty {
                    events.clear();
                    // Process the fact that one or more event was received
            }
    }
    ```

    Profile par_for_each(_mut) tasks (#4711)
    
    # Objective
    `Query::par_for_each` and it's variants do not show up when profiling using `tracy` or other profilers. Failing to show the impact of changing batch size, the overhead of scheduling tasks, overall thread utilization, etc. other than the effect on the surrounding system.
    
    ## Solution
    Add a child span that is entered on every spawned task.
    
    Example view of the results in `tracy` using a modified `parallel_query`:

    bevy_reflect_derive: Tidying up the code (#4712)
    
    # Objective
    
    The `bevy_reflect_derive` crate is not the cleanest or easiest to follow/maintain. The `lib.rs` file is especially difficult with over 1000 lines of code written in a confusing order. This is just a result of growth within the crate and it would be nice to clean it up for future work.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Split `bevy_reflect_derive` into many more submodules. The submodules include:
    
    * `container_attributes` - Code relating to container attributes
    * `derive_data` - Code relating to reflection-based derive metadata
    * `field_attributes` - Code relating to field attributes
    * `impls` - Code containing actual reflection implementations
    * `reflect_value` - Code relating to reflection-based value metadata
    * `registration` - Code relating to type registration
    * `utility` - General-purpose utility functions
    
    This leaves the `lib.rs` file to contain only the public macros, making it much easier to digest (and fewer than 200 lines).
    
    By breaking up the code into smaller modules, we make it easier for future contributors to find the code they're looking for or identify which module best fits their own additions.
    
    ### Metadata Structs
    
    This cleanup also adds two big metadata structs: `ReflectFieldAttr` and `ReflectDeriveData`. The former is used to store all attributes for a struct field (if any). The latter is used to store all metadata for struct-based derive inputs.
    
    Both significantly reduce code duplication and make editing these macros much simpler. The tradeoff is that we may collect more metadata than needed. However, this is usually a small thing (such as checking for attributes when they're not really needed or creating a `ReflectFieldAttr` for every field regardless of whether they actually have an attribute).
    
    We could try to remove these tradeoffs and squeeze some more performance out, but doing so might come at the cost of developer experience. Personally, I think it's much nicer to create a `ReflectFieldAttr` for every field since it means I don't have to do two `Option` checks. Others may disagree, though, and so we can discuss changing this either in this PR or in a future one.
    
    ### Out of Scope
    
    _Some_ documentation has been added or improved, but ultimately good docs are probably best saved for a dedicated PR.
    
    ## 🔍 Focus Points (for reviewers)
    
    I know it's a lot to sift through, so here is a list of **key points for reviewers**:
    
    - The following files contain code that was mostly just relocated:
      - `reflect_value.rs`
      - `registration.rs`
    - `container_attributes.rs` was also mostly moved but features some general cleanup (reducing nesting, removing hardcoded strings, etc.) and lots of doc comments
    - Most impl logic was moved from `lib.rs` to `impls.rs`, but they have been significantly modified to use the new `ReflectDeriveData` metadata struct in order to reduce duplication.
    - `derive_data.rs` and `field_attributes.rs` contain almost entirely new code and should probably be given the most attention.
    - Likewise, `from_reflect.rs` saw major changes using `ReflectDeriveData` so it should also be given focus.
    - There was no change to the `lib.rs` exports so the end-user API should be the same.
    
    ## Prior Work
    
    This task was initially tackled by @NathanSWard in #2377 (which was closed in favor of this PR), so hats off to them for beating me to the punch by nearly a year!
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    * **[INTERNAL]** Split `bevy_reflect_derive` into smaller submodules
    * **[INTERNAL]** Add `ReflectFieldAttr`
    * **[INTERNAL]** Add `ReflectDeriveData`
    * Add `BevyManifest::get_path_direct()` method (`bevy_macro_utils`)

    fix tracy frame marker placement (after preseting *all* windows) (#4731)
    
    # Objective
    
    The frame marker event was emitted in the loop of presenting all the windows. This would mark the frame as finished multiple times if more than one window is used.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Move the frame marker to after the `for`-loop, so that it gets executed only once.

    Tidy up the code of events (#4713)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The code in `events.rs` was a bit messy. There was lots of duplication between `EventReader` and `ManualEventReader`, and the state management code is not needed.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Clean it up.
    
    ## Future work
    
    Should we remove the type parameter from `ManualEventReader`?
    It doesn't have any meaning outside of its source `Events`. But there's no real reason why it needs to have a type parameter - it's just plain data. I didn't remove it yet to keep the type safety in some of the users of it (primarily related to `&mut World` usage)

    Add macro to implement reflect for struct types and migrate glam types (#4540)
    
    # Objective
    
    Relevant issue: #4474
    
    Currently glam types implement Reflect as a value, which is problematic for reflection, making scripting/editor work much more difficult. This PR re-implements them as structs.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added a new proc macro, `impl_reflect_struct`, which replaces `impl_reflect_value` and `impl_from_reflect_value` for glam types. This macro could also be used for other types, but I don't know of any that would require it. It's specifically useful for foreign types that cannot derive Reflect normally.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    - `impl_reflect_struct` proc macro
    
    ### Changed
    - Glam reflect impls have been replaced with `impl_reflect_struct`
    - from_reflect's `impl_struct` altered to take an optional custom constructor, allowing non-default non-constructible foreign types to use it
    - Calls to `impl_struct` altered to conform to new signature
    - Altered glam types (All vec/mat combinations) have a different serialization structure, as they are reflected differently now.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    This will break altered glam types serialized to RON scenes, as they will expect to be serialized/deserialized as structs rather than values now. A future PR to add custom serialization for non-value types is likely on the way to restore previous behavior. Additionally, calls to `impl_struct` must add a `None` parameter to the end of the call to restore previous behavior.

    Add comparison methods to FilteredAccessSet  (#4211)
    
    # Objective
    
    - (Eventually) reduce noise in reporting access conflicts between unordered systems.
            - `SystemStage` only looks at unfiltered `ComponentId` access, any conflicts reported are potentially `false`.
                    - the systems could still be accessing disjoint archetypes
            - Comparing systems' filtered access sets can maybe avoid that (for statically known component types).
                    - #4204
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Modify `SparseSetIndex` trait to require `PartialEq`, `Eq`, and `Hash` (all internal types except `BundleId` already did).
    - Add `is_compatible` and `get_conflicts` methods to `FilteredAccessSet<T>`
            - (existing method renamed to `get_conflicts_single`)
    - Add docs for those and all the other methods while I'm at it.

    - In this case, the system should have been migrated similary to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4180 anyway, so I've done that.

    Make change lifespan deterministic and update docs (#3956)
    
    ## Objective
    
    - ~~Make absurdly long-lived changes stay detectable for even longer (without leveling up to `u64`).~~
    - Give all changes a consistent maximum lifespan.
    - Improve code clarity.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - ~~Increase the frequency of `check_tick` scans to increase the oldest reliably-detectable change.~~
    (Deferred until we can benchmark the cost of a scan.)
    - Ignore changes older than the maximum reliably-detectable age.
    - General refactoring—name the constants, use them everywhere, and update the docs.
    - Update test cases to check for the specified behavior.
    
    ## Related
    
    This PR addresses (at least partially) the concerns raised in:
    
    - #3071
    - #3082 (and associated PR #3084)
    
    ## Background
    
    - #1471
    
    Given the minimum interval between `check_ticks` scans, `N`, the oldest reliably-detectable change is `u32::MAX - (2 * N - 1)` (or `MAX_CHANGE_AGE`). Reducing `N` from ~530 million (current value) to something like ~2 million would extend the lifetime of changes by a billion.
    
    | minimum `check_ticks` interval | oldest reliably-detectable change  | usable % of `u32::MAX` |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `u32::MAX / 8`  (536,870,911) | `(u32::MAX / 4) * 3` | 75.0% |
    | `2_000_000` | `u32::MAX - 3_999_999` | 99.9% |
    
    Similarly, changes are still allowed to be between `MAX_CHANGE_AGE`-old and `u32::MAX`-old in the interim between `check_tick` scans. While we prevent their age from overflowing, the test to detect changes still compares raw values. This makes failure ultimately unreliable, since when ancient changes stop being detected varies depending on when the next scan occurs.
    
    ## Open Question
    
    Currently, systems and system states are incorrectly initialized with their `last_change_tick` set to `0`, which doesn't handle wraparound correctly.
    
    For consistent behavior, they should either be initialized to the world's `last_change_tick` (and detect no changes) or to `MAX_CHANGE_AGE` behind the world's current `change_tick` (and detect everything as a change). I've currently gone with the latter since that was closer to the existing behavior.
    
    ## Follow-up Work
    
    (Edited: entire section)
    
    We haven't actually profiled how long a `check_ticks` scan takes on a "large" `World` , so we don't know if it's safe to increase their frequency. However, we are currently relying on play sessions not lasting long enough to trigger a scan and apps not having enough entities/archetypes for it to be "expensive" (our assumption). That isn't a real solution. (Either scanning never costs enough to impact frame times or we provide an option to use `u64` change ticks. Nobody will accept random hiccups.)
    
    To further extend the lifetime of changes, we actually only need to increment the world tick if a system has `Fetch: !ReadOnlySystemParamFetch`. The behavior will be identical because all writes are sequenced, but I'm not sure how to implement that in a way that the compiler can optimize the branch out.
    
    Also, since having no false positives depends on a `check_ticks` scan running at least every `2 * N - 1` ticks, a `last_check_tick` should also be stored in the `World` so that any lull in system execution (like a command flush) could trigger a scan if needed. To be completely robust, all the systems initialized on the world should be scanned, not just those in the current stage.

    Add missing audio/ogg file extensions: .oga, .spx (#4703)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add two missing ogg vorbis audio extensions.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add the two missing extensions to the list
      - The file format is the same, there are simply two other possible extensions files can use.
      - This can be easily (manually) tested by renaming the extension of `assets/sounds/Windless Slopes.ogg` to end in either `.oga` or `.spx` (in both the filesystem and in `examples/audio/audio.rs`) and then running `cargo run --example audio` and observing that the music still plays.
    
    ## More info
    
    From the [wikipedia article for Ogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg):
    
    > Ogg audio media is registered as [IANA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority) [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) audio/ogg with file extensions .oga, .ogg, and [.spx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speex).
    
    The current workaround is to rename any files ending in `.oga` or `.spx` to end in `.ogg` instead, which complicates tracking assets procured from other organizations.
    
    See also [a corresponding change to bevy_kira_audio](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_kira_audio/pull/8)
    
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    - Vorbis audio files may now use the `.oga` and `.spx` filename extensions in addition to the more common `.ogg` filename extension.

    create mutable versions of `TypeRegistry` methods (#4484)
    
    # Objective
    
    It is possible to get a mutable reference to a `TypeRegistration` using
    `TypeRegistry::get_mut`. However, none of its other methods
    (`get_mut_with_name`, `get_type_data`, `iter`, etc.) have mutable
    versions.
    
    Besides improving consistency, this change would facilitate use cases
    which involve storing mutable state data in the `TypeRegistry`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Provides a trivial wrapper around the mutable accessors that the
    `TypeRegistration` already provides. Exactly mirrors the existing
    immutable versions.

    Make public macros more robust with $crate (#4655)
    
    # Objective
    
    We have some macros that are public but only used internally for now. They fail on user's code due to the use of crate names like `bevy_utils`, while the user only has `bevy::utils`. There are two affected macros.
    
    - `bevy_utils::define_label`: it may be useful in user's code for defining custom kinds of label traits (this is why I made this PR).
    - `bevy_asset::load_internal_asset`: not useful currently due to limitations of the debug asset server, but this may change in the future.
    
    ## Solution
    
    We can make them work by using `$crate` instead of names of their own crates, which can refer to the macro's defining crate regardless of the user's setup. Even though our objective is rather low-priority here, the solution adds no maintenance cost so it is still worthwhile.

    simple tool to compare traces between executions (#4628)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Have an easy way to compare spans between executions
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a tool to compare spans from chrome traces
    
    ```bash
    > cargo run --release  -p spancmp -- --help
       Compiling spancmp v0.1.0
        Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 1.10s
         Running `target/release/spancmp --help`
    spancmp
    
    USAGE:
        spancmp [OPTIONS] <TRACE> [SECOND_TRACE]
    
    ARGS:
        <TRACE>
        <SECOND_TRACE>
    
    OPTIONS:
        -h, --help                     Print help information
        -p, --pattern <PATTERN>        Filter spans by name matching the pattern
        -t, --threshold <THRESHOLD>    Filter spans that have an average shorther than the threshold
                                       [default: 0]
    ```
    
    for each span, it will display the count, minimum duration, average duration and max duration. It can be filtered by a pattern on the span name or by a minimum average duration.

    some cleanup for `bevy_ptr` (#4668)
    
    1. change `PtrMut::as_ptr(self)` and `OwnedPtr::as_ptr(self)` to take `&self`, otherwise printing the pointer will prevent doing anything else afterwards
    2. make all `as_ptr` methods safe. There's nothing unsafe about obtaining a pointer, these kinds of methods are safe in std as well [str::as_ptr](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#method.as_ptr), [Rc::as_ptr](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/rc/struct.Rc.html#method.as_ptr)
    3. rename `offset`/`add` to `byte_offset`/`byte_add`. The unprefixed methods in std add in increments of `std::mem::size_of::<T>`, not in bytes. There's a PR for rust to add these byte_ methods https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95643 and at the call site it makes it much more clear that you need to do `.byte_add(i * layout_size)` instead of `.add(i)`

    Allow closing windows at runtime (#3575)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #3180, builds from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2898
    
    ## Solution
    
    Support requesting a window to be closed and closing a window in `bevy_window`, and handle this in `bevy_winit`.
    
    This is a stopgap until we move to windows as entites, which I'm sure I'll get around to eventually.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    
    - `Window::close` to allow closing windows.
    - `WindowClosed` to allow reacting to windows being closed.
    
    ### Changed
    
    Replaced `bevy::system::exit_on_esc_system` with `bevy::window::close_on_esc`.
    
    ## Fixed
    
    The app no longer exits when any window is closed. This difference is only observable when there are multiple windows.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    `bevy::input::system::exit_on_esc_system` has been removed. Use `bevy::window::close_on_esc` instead.
    `CloseWindow` has been removed. Use `Window::close` instead.
    The `Close` variant has been added to `WindowCommand`. Handle this by closing the relevant window.

    Add support for vertex colors (#4528)
    
    # Objective
    
    Add support for vertex colors
    
    ## Solution
    
    This change is modeled after how vertex tangents are handled, so the shader is conditionally compiled with vertex color support if the mesh has the corresponding attribute set.
    
    Vertex colors are multiplied by the base color. I'm not sure if this is the best for all cases, but may be useful for modifying vertex colors without creating a new mesh.
    
    I chose `VertexFormat::Float32x4`, but I'd prefer 16-bit floats if/when support is added.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Added
    - Vertex colors can be specified using the `Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_COLOR` mesh attribute.

    Add RegularPolygon and Circle meshes (#3730)
    
    # Objective
    
    Bevy users often want to create circles and other simple shapes.
    
    All the machinery is in place to accomplish this, and there are external crates that help. But when writing code for e.g. a new bevy example, it's not really possible to draw a circle without bringing in a new asset, writing a bunch of scary looking mesh code, or adding a dependency.
    
    In particular, this PR was inspired by this interaction in another PR: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3721#issuecomment-1016774535
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR adds `shape::RegularPolygon` and `shape::Circle` (which is just a `RegularPolygon` that defaults to a large number of sides)
    
    ## Discussion
    
    There's a lot of ongoing discussion about shapes in <https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/12> and at least one other lingering shape PR (although it seems incomplete).
    
    That RFC currently includes `RegularPolygon` and `Circle` shapes, so I don't think that having working mesh generation code in the engine for those shapes would add much burden to an author of an implementation.
    
    But if we'd prefer not to add additional shapes until after that's sorted out, I'm happy to close this for now.
    
    ## Alternatives for users
    
    For any users stumbling on this issue, here are some plugins that will help if you need more shapes.

    set alpha_mode based on alpha value (#4658)
    
    # Objective
    
    - When spawning a sprite the alpha is used for transparency, but when using the `Color::into()` implementation to spawn a `StandardMaterial`, the alpha is ignored.
    - Pretty much everytime I want to make something transparent I started with a `Color::rgb().into()` and I'm always surprised that it doesn't work when changing it to  `Color::rgba().into()`
    - It's possible there's an issue with this approach I am not thinking of, but I'm not sure what's the point of setting an alpha value without the goal of making a color transparent.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Set the alpha_mode to AlphaMode::Blend when the alpha is not the default value.
    
    ---
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    This is not a breaking change, but it can easily be migrated to reduce boilerplate
    
    ```rust
    commands.spawn_bundle(PbrBundle {
        mesh: meshes.add(shape::Cube::default().into()),
        material: materials.add(StandardMaterial {
            base_color: Color::rgba(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75),
            alpha_mode: AlphaMode::Blend,
            ..default()
        }),
        ..default()
    });
    
    // becomes
    
    commands.spawn_bundle(PbrBundle {
        mesh: meshes.add(shape::Cube::default().into()),
        material: materials.add(Color::rgba(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.75).into()),

    `bevy_ptr` standalone crate (#4653)
    
    # Objective
    
    The pointer types introduced in #3001 are useful not just in `bevy_ecs`, but also in crates like `bevy_reflect` (#4475) or even outside of bevy.

    Extract `Ptr<'a>`, `PtrMut<'a>`, `OwnedPtr<'a>`, `ThinSlicePtr<'a, T>` and `UnsafeCellDeref` from `bevy_ecs::ptr` into `bevy_ptr`.
    
    **Note:** `bevy_ecs` still reexports the `bevy_ptr` as `bevy_ecs::ptr` so that crates like `bevy_transform` can use the `Bundle` derive without needing to depend on `bevy_ptr` themselves.

    Pointerfication followup: Type safety and cleanup (#4621)
    
    # Objective
    The `Ptr` types gives free access to the underlying `NonNull<u8>`, which adds more publicly visible pointer wrangling than there needs to be. There are also a few edge cases where Ptr types could be more readily utilized for properly validating the soundness of ECS operations.
    
    ## Solution
     - Replace `*Ptr(Mut)::inner` with `cast` which requires a concrete type to give the pointer. This function could also have a `debug_assert` with an alignment check to ensure that the pointer is aligned properly, but is currently not included.
     - Use `OwningPtr::read` in ECS macros over casting the inner pointer around.

    add `#[reflect(Default)]` to create default value for reflected types (#3733)
    
    ### Problem
    It currently isn't possible to construct the default value of a reflected type. Because of that, it isn't possible to use `add_component` of `ReflectComponent` to add a new component to an entity because you can't know what the initial value should be.
    
    ### Solution
    
    1. add `ReflectDefault` type
    ```rust
    #[derive(Clone)]
    pub struct ReflectDefault {
        default: fn() -> Box<dyn Reflect>,
    }
    
    impl ReflectDefault {
        pub fn default(&self) -> Box<dyn Reflect> {
            (self.default)()
        }
    }
    
    impl<T: Reflect + Default> FromType<T> for ReflectDefault {
        fn from_type() -> Self {
            ReflectDefault {
                default: || Box::new(T::default()),
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    2. add `#[reflect(Default)]` to all component types that implement `Default` and are user facing (so not `ComputedSize`, `CubemapVisibleEntities` etc.)
    
    
    
    This makes it possible to add the default value of a component to an entity without any compile-time information:
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut app = App::new();
        app.register_type::<Camera>();
    
        let type_registry = app.world.get_resource::<TypeRegistry>().unwrap();
        let type_registry = type_registry.read();
    
        let camera_registration = type_registry.get(std::any::TypeId::of::<Camera>()).unwrap();
        let reflect_default = camera_registration.data::<ReflectDefault>().unwrap();
        let reflect_component = camera_registration
            .data::<ReflectComponent>()
            .unwrap()
            .clone();
    
        let default = reflect_default.default();
    
        drop(type_registry);
    
        let entity = app.world.spawn().id();
        reflect_component.add_component(&mut app.world, entity, &*default);
    
        let camera = app.world.entity(entity).get::<Camera>().unwrap();
        dbg!(&camera);
    }
    ```
    
    ### Open questions
    - should we have `ReflectDefault` or `ReflectFromWorld` or both?

    Filter material handles on extraction (#4178)
    
    # Objective
    
    - While optimising many_cubes, I noticed that all material handles are extracted regardless of whether the entity to which the handle belongs is visible or not. As such >100k handles are extracted when only <20k are visible.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Only extract material handles of visible entities.
    - This improves `many_cubes -- sphere` from ~42fps to ~48fps. It reduces not only the extraction time but also system commands time. `Handle<StandardMaterial>` extraction and its system commands went from 0.522ms + 3.710ms respectively, to 0.267ms + 0.227ms an 88% reduction for this system for this case. It's very view dependent but...

    CI tool usage (#3876)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Original objective was to add doc build warning check to the ci local execution
    - I somewhat deviated and changed other things...
    
    ## Solution
    
    `cargo run -p ci` can now take more parameters:
    * `format` - cargo fmt
    * `clippy` - clippy
    * `compile-fail` - bevy_ecs_compile_fail_tests tests
    * `test` - tests but not doc tests and do not build examples
    * `doc-test` - doc tests
    * `doc-check` - doc build and warnings
    * `bench-check` - check that benches build
    * `example-check` - check that examples build
    * `lints` - group - run lints and format and clippy
    * `doc` - group - run doc-test and doc-check
    * `compile` - group - run compile-fail and bench-check and example-check
    * not providing a parameter will run everything
    
    Ci is using those when possible:
    * `build` jobs now don't run doc tests and don't build examples. it makes this job faster, but doc tests and examples are not built for each architecture target
    * `ci` job doesn't run the `compile-fail` part but only format and clippy, taking less time
    * `check-benches` becomes `check-compiles` and runs the `compile` tasks. It takes longer. I also fixed how it was using cache
    * `check-doc` job is now independent and also run the doc tests, so it takes longer. I commented out the deadlinks check as it takes 2.5 minutes (to install) and doesn't work

    Improve debugging tools for change detection (#4160)
    
    # Objective
    
    1. Previously, the `change_tick` and `last_change_tick` fields on `SystemChangeTick` [were `pub`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.6.1/bevy/ecs/system/struct.SystemChangeTick.html).
       1.  This was actively misleading, as while this can be fetched as a `SystemParam`, a copy is returned instead
    2. This information could be useful for debugging, but there was no way to investigate when data was changed.
    3. There were no docs!
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. Move these to a getter method.
    2. Add `last_changed` method to the `DetectChanges` trait to enable inspection of when data was last changed.
    3. Add docs.
    
    # Changelog
    
     `SystemChangeTick` now provides getter methods for the current and previous change tick, rather than public fields.
     This can be combined with `DetectChanges::last_changed()` to debug the timing of changes.
    
    # Migration guide
    
    The `change_tick` and `last_change_tick` fields on `SystemChangeTick` are now private, use the corresponding getter method instead.

    move system_param fetch struct into anonymous scope to avoid name collisions (#4100)
    
    # Objective
    
    avoid naming collisions with user structs when deriving ``system_param``.
    
    ## Solution
    
    ~rename the fetch struct created by ``#[derive(system_param)]`` from ``{}State`` to ``{}SysParamState``.~
    place the fetch struct into an anonymous scope.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    For code that was using a system param's fetch struct, such as ``EventReader``'s ``EventReaderState``, the fetch struct can now be identified via the SystemParam trait associated type ``Fetch``, e.g. for ``EventReader<T>`` it can be identified as ``<EventReader<'static, 'static, T> as SystemParam>::Fetch``

    Make `Transform` propagation correct in the presence of updated children (#4608)
    
    Supercedes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3340, and absorbs the test from there.
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #3329
    
    ## Solution
    
    - If the `Children` component has changed, we currently do not have a way to know how it has changed.
    - Therefore, we must update the hierarchy downwards  from that point to be correct.

    bevy_reflect: Add `GetTypeRegistration` impl for reflected tuples (#4226)
    
    # Objective
    
    Reflected tuples do not implement `GetTypeRegistration`, preventing us from registering our tuples, like:
    
    ```rust
    app.register_type::<(i32, i32)>();
    ```
    
    This is especially important for things like using #4042 to improve the scene format or implementing #4154 to recursively register fields.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added an implementation to the tuple macro:
    
    ```rust
    impl<$($name: Reflect + for<'de> Deserialize<'de>),*> GetTypeRegistration for ($($name,)*) {
      fn get_type_registration() -> TypeRegistration {
        let mut registration = TypeRegistration::of::<($($name,)*)>();
        registration.insert::<ReflectDeserialize>(FromType::<($($name,)*)>::from_type());
        registration
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This requires that the tuple's types implement `Deserialize`. This is exactly how `Vec` and `HashMap` handle it:
    
    ```rust
    impl<T: FromReflect + for<'de> Deserialize<'de>> GetTypeRegistration for Vec<T> {
      fn get_type_registration() -> TypeRegistration {
        let mut registration = TypeRegistration::of::<Vec<T>>();
        registration.insert::<ReflectDeserialize>(FromType::<Vec<T>>::from_type());
        registration
      }
    }
    ```

    This is a replacement for #2106
    
    This adds a `Metadata` struct which contains metadata information about a file, at the moment only the file type.
    It also adds a `get_metadata` to `AssetIo` trait and an `asset_io` accessor method to `AssetServer` and `LoadContext`
    
    I am not sure about the changes in `AndroidAssetIo ` and `WasmAssetIo`.

    Add 3d shapes example (#4613)
    
    # Objective
    
    - As requested here: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/4520#issuecomment-1109302039
    - Make it easier to spot issues with built-in shapes
    
    ## Solution
    
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200550/165624709-c40dfe7e-0e1e-4bd3-ae52-8ae66888c171.mp4
    
    - Add an example showcasing the built-in 3d shapes with lighting/shadows
    - Rotate objects in such a way that all faces are seen by the camera
    - Add a UV debug texture
    
    ## Discussion
    
    I'm not sure if this is what @alice-i-cecile had in mind, but I adapted the little "torus playground" from the issue linked above to include all built-in shapes.
    
    This exact arrangement might not be particularly scalable if many more shapes are added. Maybe a slow camera pan, or cycling with the keyboard or on a timer, or a sidebar with buttons would work better. If one of the latter options is used, options for showing wireframes or computed flat normals might add some additional utility.
    
    Ideally, I think we'd have a better way of visualizing normals.
    
    Happy to rework this or close it if there's not a consensus around it being useful.

    Change `gamepad.rs` tuples to normal structs (#4519)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Part of the splitting process of #3692.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove / change the tuple structs inside of `gamepad.rs` of `bevy_input` to normal structs.
    
    ## Reasons
    
    - It made the `gamepad_connection_system` cleaner.
    - It made the `gamepad_input_events.rs` example cleaner (which is probably the most notable change for the user facing API).
    - Tuple structs are not descriptive (`.0`, `.1`).
    - Using tuple structs for more than 1 field is a bad idea (This means that the `Gamepad` type might be fine as a tuple struct, but I still prefer normal structs over tuple structs).
    
    Feel free to discuss this change as this is more or less just a matter of taste.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - The `Gamepad`, `GamepadButton`, `GamepadAxis`, `GamepadEvent` and `GamepadEventRaw` types are now normal structs instead of tuple structs and have a `new()` function.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - The `Gamepad`, `GamepadButton`, `GamepadAxis`, `GamepadEvent` and `GamepadEventRaw` types are now normal structs instead of tuple structs and have a `new()` function. To migrate change every instantiation to use the `new()` function instead and use the appropriate field names instead of `.0` and `.1`.

    Use lifetimed, type erased pointers in bevy_ecs (#3001)
    
    # Objective
    
    `bevy_ecs` has large amounts of unsafe code which is hard to get right and makes it difficult to audit for soundness.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Introduce lifetimed, type-erased pointers: `Ptr<'a>` `PtrMut<'a>` `OwningPtr<'a>'` and `ThinSlicePtr<'a, T>` which are newtypes around a raw pointer with a lifetime and conceptually representing strong invariants about the pointee and validity of the pointer.
    
    The process of converting bevy_ecs to use these has already caught multiple cases of unsound behavior.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    TL;DR for release notes: `bevy_ecs` now uses lifetimed, type-erased pointers internally, significantly improving safety and legibility without sacrificing performance. This should have approximately no end user impact, unless you were meddling with the (unfortunately public) internals of `bevy_ecs`.
    
    - `Fetch`, `FilterFetch` and `ReadOnlyFetch` trait no longer have a `'state` lifetime
        - this was unneeded
    - `ReadOnly/Fetch` associated types on `WorldQuery` are now on a new `WorldQueryGats<'world>` trait
        - was required to work around lack of Generic Associated Types (we wish to express `type Fetch<'a>: Fetch<'a>`)
    - `derive(WorldQuery)` no longer requires `'w` lifetime on struct
        - this was unneeded, and improves the end user experience
    - `EntityMut::get_unchecked_mut` returns `&'_ mut T` not `&'w mut T`
        - allows easier use of unsafe API with less footguns, and can be worked around via lifetime transmutery as a user
    - `Bundle::from_components` now takes a `ctx` parameter to pass to the `FnMut` closure
        - required because closure return types can't borrow from captures
    - `Fetch::init` takes `&'world World`, `Fetch::set_archetype` takes `&'world Archetype` and `&'world Tables`, `Fetch::set_table` takes `&'world Table`
        - allows types implementing `Fetch` to store borrows into world
    - `WorldQuery` trait now has a `shrink` fn to shorten the lifetime in `Fetch::<'a>::Item`
        - this works around lack of subtyping of assoc types, rust doesnt allow you to turn `<T as Fetch<'static>>::Item'` into `<T as Fetch<'a>>::Item'`
        - `QueryCombinationsIter` requires this
    - Most types implementing `Fetch` now have a lifetime `'w`
        - allows the fetches to store borrows of world data instead of using raw pointers
    
    ## Migration guide
    
    - `EntityMut::get_unchecked_mut` returns a more restricted lifetime, there is no general way to migrate this as it depends on your code
    - `Bundle::from_components` implementations must pass the `ctx` arg to `func`
    - `Bundle::from_components` callers have to use a fn arg instead of closure captures for borrowing from world
    - Remove lifetime args on `derive(WorldQuery)` structs as it is nonsensical
    - `<Q as WorldQuery>::ReadOnly/Fetch` should be changed to either `RO/QueryFetch<'world>` or `<Q as WorldQueryGats<'world>>::ReadOnly/Fetch`
    - `<F as Fetch<'w, 's>>` should be changed to `<F as Fetch<'w>>`
    - Change the fn sigs of `Fetch::init/set_archetype/set_table` to match respective trait fn sigs
    - Implement the required `fn shrink` on any `WorldQuery` implementations
    - Move assoc types `Fetch` and `ReadOnlyFetch` on `WorldQuery` impls to `WorldQueryGats` impls
    - Pass an appropriate `'world` lifetime to whatever fetch struct you are for some reason using
    
    ### Type inference regression
    
    in some cases rustc may give spurrious errors when attempting to infer the `F` parameter on a query/querystate this can be fixed by manually specifying the type, i.e. `QueryState::new::<_, ()>(world)`. The error is rather confusing:
    
    ```rust=
    error[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `<() as Fetch<'_>>::Item == bool`
        --> crates/bevy_pbr/src/render/light.rs:1413:30
         |
    1413 |             main_view_query: QueryState::new(world),
         |                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found `()`
         |
         = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `for<'x> FilterFetch<'x>` for `<() as WorldQueryGats<'x>>::Fetch`
    note: required by a bound in `bevy_ecs::query::QueryState::<Q, F>::new`

    Decouple some dependencies (#3886)
    
    # Objective
    
    Reduce from scratch build time.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Reduce the size of the critical path by removing dependencies between crates where not necessary. For `cargo check --no-default-features` this reduced build time from ~51s to ~45s. For some commits I am not completely sure if the tradeoff between build time reduction and convenience caused by the commit is acceptable. If not, I can drop them.

    Improve QueryIter size_hint hints (#4244)
    
    ## Objective
    
    This fixes #1686.
    
    `size_hint` can be useful even if a little niche. For example,
    `collect::<Vec<_>>()` uses the `size_hint` of Iterator it collects from
    to pre-allocate a memory slice large enough to not require re-allocating
    when pushing all the elements of the iterator.
    
    ## Solution
    
    To this effect I made the following changes:
    * Add a `IS_ARCHETYPAL` associated constant to the `Fetch` trait,
      this constant tells us when it is safe to assume that the `Fetch`
      relies exclusively on archetypes to filter queried entities
    * Add `IS_ARCHETYPAL` to all the implementations of `Fetch`
    * Use that constant in `QueryIter::size_hint` to provide a more useful
    
    ## Migration guide
    
    The new associated constant is an API breaking change. For the user,
    if they implemented a custom `Fetch`, it means they have to add this
    associated constant to their implementation. Either `true` if it doesn't limit
    the number of entities returned in a query beyond that of archetypes, or
    `false` for when it does.

    Move float_ord from bevy_core to bevy_utils (#4189)
    
    # Objective
    
    Reduce the catch-all grab-bag of functionality in bevy_core by moving FloatOrd to bevy_utils.
    
    A step in addressing #2931 and splitting bevy_core into more specific locations.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Move FloatOrd into bevy_utils. Fix the compile errors.
    
    As a result, bevy_core_pipeline, bevy_pbr, bevy_sprite, bevy_text, and bevy_ui no longer depend on bevy_core (they were only using it for `FloatOrd` previously).

    Add an example to test small window sizes (#3597)
    
    # Objective
    
    We keep getting issues where things break at small window sizes, e.g #3368 (caused by #3153), #3596 ('caused' by #3545)

    - Add a test that we can make small windows.
    
    
    Currently, this fails on my machine with some quite scary vulkan errors:

    bevy_reflect: Added `PartialEq` to reflected `f32` & `f64` (#4217)
    
    # Objective
    
    Comparing two reflected floating points would always fail:
    
    ```rust
    let a: &dyn Reflect = &1.23_f32;
    let b: &dyn Reflect = &1.23_f32;
    
    // Panics:
    assert!(a.reflect_partial_eq(b).unwrap_or_default());
    ```
    
    The comparison returns `None` since `f32` (and `f64`) does not have a reflected `PartialEq` implementation.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Include `PartialEq` in the `impl_reflect_value!` macro call for both `f32` and `f64`.
    
    `Hash` is still excluded since neither implement `Hash`.
    
    Also added equality tests for some of the common types from `std` (including `f32`).

    re-enable `#[derive(TypeUuid)]` for generics (#4118)
    
    Support for deriving `TypeUuid` for types with generics was initially added in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2044 but later reverted https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2204 because it lead to `MyStruct<A>` and `MyStruct<B>` having the same type uuid.
    
    This PR fixes this by generating code like
    ```rust
    #[derive(TypeUuid)]
    #[uuid = "69b09733-a21a-4dab-a444-d472986bd672"]
    struct Type<T>(T);
    
    impl<T: TypeUuid> TypeUuid for Type<T> {
      const TYPE_UUID: TypeUuid = generate_compound_uuid(Uuid::from_bytes([/* 69b0 uuid */]), T::TYPE_UUID);
    }
    ```
    
    where `generate_compound_uuid` will XOR the non-metadata bits of the two UUIDs.

    Make paused timers update `just_finished` on tick (#4445)
    
    # Objective
    Make timers update `just_finished` on tick, even if paused.
    Fixes #4436
    
    ## Solution
    `just_finished()` returns `times_finished > 0`. So I:
     * Renamed `times_finished` to `times_finished_this_tick` to reduce confusion.
     * Set `times_finished_this_tick` to `0` on tick when paused.
     * Additionally set `finished` to `false` if the timer is repeating.
    
    Notably this change broke none of the existing tests, so I added a couple for this.
    
    Files changed shows a lot of noise because of the rename. Check the first commit for the relevant changes.

    - Move `Rect` to `bevy_ui` and rename it to `UiRect`.

    - `Rect` is only used in `bevy_ui` and therefore calling it `UiRect` makes the intent clearer.
    - We have two types that are called `Rect` currently and it's missleading (see `bevy_sprite::Rect` and #335).

    bevy_reflect: Add `as_reflect` and `as_reflect_mut` (#4350)
    
    # Objective
    
    Trait objects that have `Reflect` as a supertrait cannot be upcast to a `dyn Reflect`.
    
    Attempting something like:
    
    ```rust
    trait MyTrait: Reflect {
      // ...
    }
    
    fn foo(value: &dyn MyTrait) {
      let reflected = value as &dyn Reflect; // Error!
      // ...
    }
    ```
    
    Results in `error[E0658]: trait upcasting coercion is experimental`.
    
    The reason this is important is that a lot of `bevy_reflect` methods require a `&dyn Reflect`. This is trivial with concrete types, but if we don't know the concrete type (we only have the trait object), we can't use these methods. For example, we couldn't create a `ReflectSerializer` for the type since it expects a `&dyn Reflect` value— even though we should be able to.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add `as_reflect` and `as_reflect_mut` to `Reflect` to allow upcasting to a `dyn Reflect`:
    
    ```rust
    trait MyTrait: Reflect {
      // ...
    }
    
    fn foo(value: &dyn MyTrait) {
      let reflected = value.as_reflect();
      // ...
    }
    ```
    
    ## Alternatives
    
    We could defer this type of logic to the crate/user. They can add these methods to their trait in the same exact way we do here. The main benefit of doing it ourselves is it makes things convenient for them (especially when using the derive macro).
    
    We could also create an `AsReflect` trait with a blanket impl over all reflected types, however, I could not get that to work for trait objects since they aren't sized.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added trait method `Reflect::as_reflect(&self)`
    - Added trait method `Reflect::as_reflect_mut(&mut self)`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Manual implementors of `Reflect` will need to add implementations for the methods above (this should be pretty easy as most cases just need to return `self`)

    # Objective
    
    - Related #4276.
    - Part of the splitting process of #3503.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Move `Size` to `bevy_ui`.
    
    ## Reasons
    
    - `Size` is only needed in `bevy_ui` (because it needs to use `Val` instead of `f32`), but it's also used as a worse `Vec2`  replacement in other areas.
    - `Vec2` is more powerful than `Size` so it should be used whenever possible.
    - Discussion in #3503.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - The `Size` type got moved from `bevy_math` to `bevy_ui`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - The `Size` type got moved from `bevy::math` to `bevy::ui`. To migrate you just have to import `bevy::ui::Size` instead of `bevy::math::Math` or use the `bevy::prelude` instead.

    Add more tests to `input.rs` (#4522)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Part of the splitting process of #3692.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add more tests to `input.rs` inside of `bevy_input`.
    
    ## Note
    
    - The tests would now catch a change like #4410 and fail accordingly.

    bevy_utils: remove hardcoded log level limit (#4580)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Debug logs are useful in release builds, but `tracing` logs are hard-capped (`release_max_level_info`) at the `info` level by `bevy_utils`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This PR simply removes the limit in `bevy_utils` with no further actions.
    - If any out-of-the box performance regressions arise, the steps to enable this `tracing` feature should be documented in a user guide in the future.
    
    This PR closes #4069 and closes #1206.
    
    ## Alternatives considered
    
    - Instruct the user to build with `debug-assertions` enabled: this is just a workaround, as it obviously enables all `debug-assertions` that affect more than logging itself.
    - Re-exporting the feature from `tracing` and enabling it by default: I believe it just adds complexity and confusion, the `tracing` feature can also be re-enabled with one line in userland.
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Fixed
    
    - Log level is not hard capped at `info` for release builds anymore.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - Maximum log levels for release builds is not enforced by Bevy anymore, to omit "debug" and "trace" level logs entirely from release builds, `tracing` must be added as a dependency with its `release_max_level_info` feature enabled in `Cargo.toml`. (`tracing = { version = "0.1", features = ["release_max_level_info"] }`)

    Make `Time::update_with_instant` public for use in tests (#4469)
    
    # Objective
    
    To test systems that implement frame rate-independent update logic, one needs to be able to mock `Time`. By mocking time, it's possible to write tests that confirm systems are frame rate-independent.
    
    This is a follow-up PR to #2549 by @ostwilkens and based on his work.
    
    ## Solution
    
    To mock `Time`, one needs to be able to manually update the Time resource with an `Instant` defined by the developer. This can be achieved by making the existing `Time::update_with_instant` method public for use in tests.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Make `Time::update_with_instant` public
    - Add doc to `Time::update_with_instant` clarifying that the method should not be called outside of tests.
    - Add doc test to `Time` demonstrating how to use `update_with_instant` in tests.

    Rename `ElementState` to `ButtonState` (#4314)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Part of the splitting process of #3692.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Rename `ElementState` to `ButtonState`
    
    ## Reasons
    
    - The old name was too generic.
    - If something can be pressed it is automatically button-like (thanks to @alice-i-cecile for bringing it up in #3692).
    - The reason it is called `ElementState` is because that's how `winit` calls it.
    - It is used to define if a keyboard or mouse **button** is pressed or not.
    - Discussion in #3692.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Changed
    
    - The `ElementState` type received a rename and is now called `ButtonState`.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - The `ElementState` type received a rename and is now called `ButtonState`. To migrate you just have to change every occurrence of `ElementState` to `ButtonState`.

    SystemSet::before and after: take AsSystemLabel (#4503)
    
    # Objective
    
    `AsSystemLabel` has been introduced on system descriptors to make ordering systems more convenient, but `SystemSet::before` and `SystemSet::after` still take `SystemLabels` directly:
    
        use bevy::ecs::system::AsSystemLabel;
        /*…*/ SystemSet::new().before(foo.as_system_label()) /*…*/
    
    is currently necessary instead of
    
        /*…*/ SystemSet::new().before(foo) /*…*/
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use `AsSystemLabel` for `SystemSet`

    Free at last!
    
    # Objective
    
    - Using `.system()` is no longer needed anywhere, and anyone using it will have already gotten a deprecation warning.
    - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3302 was a super special case for `.system()`, since it was so prevelant. However, that's no reason.
    - Despite it being deprecated, another couple of uses of it have already landed, including in the deprecating PR.
       - These have all been because of doc examples having warnings not breaking CI - 🎟️?
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove it.
    - It's gone
    
    ---
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - You can no longer use `.system()`
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - You can no longer use `.system()`. It was deprecated in 0.7.0, and you should have followed the deprecation warning then. You can just remove the method call.

    Faster assign lights to clusters (#4345)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #4234
    - Fixes #4473
    - Built on top of #3989
    - Improve performance of `assign_lights_to_clusters`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the OBB-based cluster light assignment algorithm and calculation of view space AABBs
    - Implement the 'iterative sphere refinement' algorithm used in Just Cause 3 by Emil Persson as documented in the Siggraph 2015 Practical Clustered Shading talk by Persson, on pages 42-44 http://newq.net/dl/pub/s2015_practical.pdf
    - Adapt to also support orthographic projections
    - Add `many_lights -- orthographic` for testing many lights using an orthographic projection
    
    ## Results
    
    - `assign_lights_to_clusters` in `many_lights` before this PR on an M1 Max over 1500 frames had a median execution time of 1.71ms. With this PR it is 1.51ms, a reduction of 0.2ms or 11.7% for this system.

    Add simple collision sound to breakout (#4331)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add sound effect to the breakout example
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a collision event and a system that listens to the event and plays a sound
    
    I only added a single sound for all collisions for the sake of simplicity, but this could easily be extended to play a different sound depending on the type of entity hit.
    
    The sound was generated randomly by using https://sfxr.me

    Closes #4326

    For some reason the video has a lot of delay in the sound, but when playing it locally there's no delay

    ## Changelog
    
    - Added sound to breakout example
    - Added bevy_audio and vorbis to the feature list ran for examples in CI

    More tidying of contributors example (#4443)
    
    # Objective
    
    Continue the effort to clean up this example
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Store contributor name as component to avoid awkward vec of tuples
    - Name the variable storing the Random Number Generator "rng"
    - Use init_resource for resource implementing default
    - Fix a few spots where an Entity was unnecessarily referenced and immediately dereferenced
    - Fix up an awkward comment

    add more logs when despawning entities (#3851)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Provide more information when despawning an entity
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a debug log when despawning an entity
    - Add spans to the recursive ways of despawning an entity
    
    ```sh
    RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --example panic --features trace
    # RUST_LOG=debug needed to show debug logs from bevy_ecs
    # --features trace needed to have the extra spans
    ...
    
    DEBUG bevy_app:frame:stage{name=Update}:system_commands{name="panic::despawn_parent"}:command{name="DespawnRecursive" entity=0v0}: bevy_ecs::world: Despawning entity 1v0

    Fix typos in `Time::last_update` and `Time::time_since_startup` documentation (#4470)
    
    # Objective
    
    The documentation of the `Time::last_update` and `Time::time_since_startup` methods contains typos. It uses apostrophe instead of backtick characters around `Instant` and `Duration`, so that these words are not recognized as identifiers in the generated API documentation. This should be fixed.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Fix the typos.

    Reuse texture when resolving multiple passes (#3552)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3499
    
    ## Solution
    
    Uses a `HashMap` from `RenderTarget` to sampled textures when preparing `ViewTarget`s to ensure that two passes with the same render target get sampled to the same texture.
    
    This builds on and depends on https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3412, so this will be a draft PR until #3412 is merged. All changes for this PR are in the last commit.

    scene_viewer: load cameras (#4425)
    
    # Objective
    
    glTF files can contain cameras. Currently the scene viewer example uses _a_ camera defined in the file if possible, otherwise it spawns a new one. It would be nice if instead it could load all the cameras and cycle through them, while also having a separate user-controller camera.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - instead of just a camera that is already defined, always spawn a new separate user-controller camera
    - maintain a list of loaded cameras and cycle through them (wrapping to the user-controller camera) when pressing `C`
    
    This matches the behavious that https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Sample-Viewer-Release/ has.
    
    ## Implementation notes
    
    - The gltf scene asset loader just spawns the cameras into the world, but does not return a mapping of camera index to bevy entity. So instead the scene_viewer example just collects all spawned cameras with a good old `query.iter().collect()`, so the order is unspecified and may change between runs.
    
    ## Demo

    using the virtual city glTF sample file: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/VC

    Group stress test examples (#4289)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Several examples are useful for qualitative tests of Bevy's performance
    - By contrast, these are less useful for learning material: they are often relatively complex and have large amounts of setup and are performance optimized.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Move bevymark, many_sprites and many_cubes into the new stress_tests example folder
    - Move contributors into the games folder: unlike the remaining examples in the 2d folder, it is not focused on demonstrating a clear feature.

    Audio control at start of playback (#4110)
    
    # Objective
    
    - While playing with volume, I noticed that when setting the volume just after playback start, I still get a few milliseconds at normal volume
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Replace `play_in_loop` with `play_with_settings` that allows from more controls
    - Adds a `PlaybackSettings` to specify the settings from start. Can be used: `PlaybackSettings::LOOP.with_volume(0.75)`

    bevy_app: add tracing event with `tracy.frame_mark` (#4320)
    
    Currently `tracy` interprets the entire trace as one frame because the marker for frames isn't being recorded.
    
    ~~When an event with `tracy.trace_marker=true` is recorded, `tracing-tracy` will mark the frame as finished:
    <https://github.com/nagisa/rust_tracy_client/blob/aa0b96b2ae2aee6f3831994f9a3a8c29bcc85fae/tracing-tracy/src/lib.rs#L240>~~
    
    ~~Unfortunately this leads to~~
    ```rs
    INFO bevy_app:frame: bevy_app::app: finished frame tracy.frame_mark=true
    ```
    ~~being printed every frame (we can't use DEBUG because bevy_log sets `max_release_level_info`.~~
    
    Instead of emitting an event that gets logged every frame, we can depend on tracy-client itself and call `finish_continuous_frame!();`

    Change scaling mode to FixedHorizontal (#4055)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes the issue with orthographic camera imported from glTF not displaying anything (mentioned in #4005).
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This was due to wrong scaling mode being used. This PR simply changes WindowSize scaling mode to FixedHorizontal.
    
    ## Important Note
    
    Currently, othographic scale in Blender, three.js, and possibly other software does not translate to Bevy (via glTF) because their developers have [misinterpreted the spec](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/issues/1663#issuecomment-618194015). The camera parameters have been clarified in glTF 2.0, which was released on October of 2021. In Blender 3.0.1 this issue has **not** been fixed yet. If you are importing orthographic cameras from Blender, you have to divide the scale by 2.

    - Make `set_active_camera` system correctly respond to camera deletion, while preserving its correct behavior on first ever frame and any consequent frame, and with multiple cameras of the same type available in the world.
    - Fixes #4227
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a check that the entity referred to by `ActiveCamera` still exists in the world.

    insert the gltf mesh name on the entity if there is one (#4119)
    
    # Objective
    
    - In glTF, mesh can be named. This named is used to be able to reference the mesh, but not as a component on the entity
    - Bevy only added the node name to the parent node.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Also adds the name on the mesh entity if there is one.
    
    Limitation: In glTF, it's possible to have one mesh (which can be named) corresponding to several primitives (which can't, but are the actual mesh). I added the mesh name to the entity with the `PbrBundle` matching the primitives, which means that a mesh with several primitives would all have the same name. I think this is acceptable...

    Make `System` responsible for updating its own archetypes (#4115)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make it possible to use `System`s outside of the scheduler/executor without having to define logic to track new archetypes and call `System::add_archetype()` for each.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Replace `System::add_archetype(&Archetype)` with `System::update_archetypes(&World)`, making systems responsible for tracking their own most recent archetype generation the way that `SystemState` already does.
    
    This has minimal (or simplifying) effect on most of the code with the exception of `FunctionSystem`, which must now track the latest `ArchetypeGeneration` it saw instead of relying on the executor to do it.

    Skinned extraction speedup (#4428)
    
    # Objective
    
    - While animating 501 https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/BrainStem, I noticed things were getting a little slow
    - Looking in tracy, the system `extract_skinned_meshes` is taking a lot of time, with a mean duration of 15.17ms
    
    ## Solution
    
    - ~~Use `Vec` instead of a `SmallVec`~~
    - ~~Don't use an temporary variable~~
    - Compute the affine matrix as an `Affine3A` instead
    - Remove the `temp` vec

    Use storage buffers for clustered forward point lights (#3989)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make use of storage buffers, where they are available, for clustered forward bindings to support far more point lights in a scene
    - Fixes #3605
    - Based on top of #4079
    
    This branch on an M1 Max can keep 60fps with about 2150 point lights of radius 1m in the Sponza scene where I've been testing. The bottleneck is mostly assigning lights to clusters which grows faster than linearly (I think 1000 lights was about 1.5ms and 5000 was 7.5ms). I have seen papers and presentations leveraging compute shaders that can get this up to over 1 million. That said, I think any further optimisations should probably be done in a separate PR.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `RenderDevice` to the `Material` and `SpecializedMaterial` trait `::key()` functions to allow setting flags on the keys depending on feature/limit availability
    - Make `GpuPointLights` and `ViewClusterBuffers` into enums containing `UniformVec` and `StorageBuffer` variants. Implement the necessary API on them to make usage the same for both cases, and the only difference is at initialisation time.
    - Appropriate shader defs in the shader code to handle the two cases
    
    ## Context on some decisions / open questions
    
    - I'm using `max_storage_buffers_per_shader_stage >= 3` as a check to see if storage buffers are supported. I was thinking about diving into 'binding resource management' but it feels like we don't have enough use cases to understand the problem yet, and it is mostly a separate concern to this PR, so I think it should be handled separately.
    - Should `ViewClusterBuffers` and `ViewClusterBindings` be merged, duplicating the count variables into the enum variants?

    bevy_pbr: Support flipping tangent space normal map y for DirectX normal maps (#4433)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Normal maps authored for DirectX use a left-handed convention and have their tangent space normal in the texture inverted from what we need. Support this.
    - Details here: https://doc.babylonjs.com/divingDeeper/materials/advanced/normalMaps
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `StandardMaterial` `flip_normal_map_y` boolean field
    - Add a `STANDARDMATERIAL_FLIP_NORMAL_MAP_Y` flag to `StandardMaterialFlags` and in the PBR shader
    - Flip the y-component of the tangent space normal just after sampling it from the normal map texture

    scene viewer improvements: animation reset (#4420)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Changing animation mid animation can leave the model not in its original position
    - ~~The movement speed is fixed, no matter the size of the model~~
    
    ## Solution
    
    - when changing animation, set it to its initial state and wait for one frame before changing the animation
    - ~~when settings the camera controller, use the camera transform to know how far it is from the origin and use the distance for the speed~~

    - Those were ignored as we're never exactly at the ts 0.0 of an animation. going there explicitly (`.set_elapsed(0.0).pause()`) would crash
    - Special case this as there isn't much to animate in this case

    - Part of the splitting process of #3503.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the `face_toward.rs` file containing the `FaceToward` trait.
    
    ## Reasons
    
    - It is unused inside of `bevy`.
    - The method `Mat4::face_toward` of the trait is identical to `Mat4::look_at_rh` (see https://docs.rs/glam/latest/glam/f32/struct.Mat4.html#method.look_at_rh).
    - Discussion in #3503.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Removed
    
    - The `FaceToward` trait got removed.
    
    ## Migration Guide

    fix multiple_windows example (#4389)
    
    The example was broken in #3635 when the `ActiveCamera` logic was introduced, after which there could only be one active `Camera3d` globally.
    Ideally there could be one `Camera3d` per render target, not globally, but that isn't the case yet.
    
    To fix the example, we need to
    - don't use `Camera3d` twice, add a new `SecondWindowCamera3d` marker
    - add the `CameraTypePlugin::<SecondWindowCamera3d>`
    - extract the correct `RenderPhase`s
    - add a 3d pass driver node for the secondary camera
    
    Fixes #4378

    Remove unnecessary system labels (#4340)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Since #4224, using labels which only refer to one system doesn't make sense.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove some of those.
    
    ## Future work
    
    - We should remove the ability to use strings as system labels entirely. I haven't in this PR because there are tests which use this, and that's a lot of code to change.
       - The only use cases for labels are either intra-crate, which use #4224, or inter-crate, which should either use #4224 or explicit types. Neither of those should use strings.

    Bump actions/cache from 2 to 3 (#4348)
    
    Bumps [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) from 2 to 3.
    <details>
    <summary>Release notes</summary>
    <p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache/releases">actions/cache's releases</a>.</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    <h2>v3.0.0</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>This change adds a minimum runner version(node12 -&gt; node16), which can break users using an out-of-date/fork of the runner. This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.7</h2>
    <p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>
    <h2>v2.1.6</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/596">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.5</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/527">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.4</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Make caching more verbose <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650">#650</a></li>
    <li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href="https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701">#701</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.3</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w">CVE-2020-15228</a>. This action was not using the affected methods.</li>
    <li>Fix error handling in <code>uploadChunk</code> where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.2</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds</li>
    <li>No-op when executing on GHES</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.1</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Update <code>@actions/cache</code> package to <code>v1.0.2</code> which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>v2.1.0</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Replaces the <code>http-client</code> with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently</li>
    <li>Display download progress and speed</li>

    Rename get_multiple APIs to get_many (#4384)
    
    
    # Objective
    
    -  std's new APIs do the same thing as `Query::get_multiple_mut`, but are called `get_many`: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/83608
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Find and replace `get_multiple` with `get_many`

    Fix loading non-TriangleList meshes without normals in gltf loader (#4376)
    
    # Objective
    Make it so that loading in a mesh without normals that is not a `TriangleList` succeeds.
    
    ## Solution
    Flat normals can only be calculated on a mesh made of triangles.
    Check whether the mesh is a `TriangleList` before trying to compute missing normals.
    
    ## Additional changes
    The panic condition in `duplicate_vertices` did not make sense to me. I moved it to `compute_flat_normals` where the algorithm would produce incorrect results if the mesh is not a `TriangleList`.

    - The perf comments, added (by me) in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1349, became outdated once the initialisation call started to take an exclusive reference, (presumably in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1525).

    Replace confusing links from CONTRIBUTING.md with short instruction (#4369)
    
    # Objective
    CONTRIBUTING.md contains links to pages that are restricted to Bevy Engine Org members.
    First time contributors who read CONTRIBUTING.md will end up on a confusing 404 page if they try to follow the link.
    
    Relevant discussion: #4365
    
    ## Solution
    
    Replace links with directions to the Triage Team page.
    
    ### Note
    
    I'm not sure if `assign themselves as a member` is accurate. I think that is what `automatically request membership` was referring to, but i can't check for myself :wink:

    unsafeify `World::entities_mut` (#4093)
    
    # Objective
    make bevy ecs a lil bit less unsound
    
    ## Solution
    make unsound API unsafe so that there is an unsafe block to blame:
    
    ```rust
    use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
    
    #[derive(Debug, Component)]
    struct Foo(u8);
    
    fn main() {
        let mut world = World::new();
        let e1 = world.spawn().id();
        let e2 = world.spawn().insert(Foo(2)).id();
        world.entities_mut().meta[0] = world.entities_mut().meta[1].clone();
        let foo = world.entity(e1).get::<Foo>().unwrap();
        // whoo i love having components i dont have
        dbg!(foo);
    }
    ```
    
    This is not _strictly_ speaking UB, however:
    - `Query::get_multiple` cannot work if this is allowed
    - bevy_ecs is a pile of unsafe code whose soundness generally depends on the world being in a "correct" state with "no funny business" so it seems best to disallow this
    - it is trivial to get bevy to panic inside of functions with safety invariants that have been violated (the entity location is not valid)
    - it seems to violate what the safety invariant on `Entities::flush` is trying to ensure

    impl Reflect and Debug for Mesh2dHandle (#4368)
    
    # Objective
    
    An entity spawned with `MaterialMesh2dBundle<M>` cannot be saved and spawned using `DynamicScene` because the `Mesh2dHandle` component does not `impl Reflect`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add `#[derive(Reflect)]` and `#[reflect(Component)]` to `Mesh2dHandle`, and call `register_type` in `SpritePlugin`.  Also add `#[derive(Debug)]` since I'm touching the `derive`s anyway.

    Add get_multiple and get_multiple_mut APIs for Query and QueryState (#4298)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The inability to have multiple active mutable borrows into a query is a common source of borrow-checker pain for users.
    - This is a pointless restriction if and only if we can guarantee that the entities they are accessing are unique.
    - This could already by bypassed with get_unchecked, but that is an extremely unsafe API.
    - Closes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2042.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `get_multiple`, `get_multiple_mut` and their unchecked equivalents (`multiple` and `multiple_mut`) to `Query` and `QueryState`.
    - Improve the `QueryEntityError` type to provide more useful error information.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    - Added `get_multiple`, `get_multiple_mut` and their unchecked equivalents (`multiple` and `multiple_mut`) to Query and QueryState.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - The `QueryEntityError` enum now has a `AliasedMutability variant, and returns the offending entity.
    
    ## Context
    
    This is a fresh attempt at #3333; rebasing was behaving very badly and it was important to rebase on top of the recent query soundness fixes. Many thanks to all the reviewers in that thread, especially @BoxyUwU for the help with lifetimes.
    
    ## To-do
    
    - [x] Add compile fail tests
    - [x] Successfully deduplicate code
    - [x] Decide what to do about failing doc tests
    - [x] Get some reviews for lifetime soundness

    # Objective
    Add a system parameter `ParamSet` to be used as container for conflicting parameters.
    
    ## Solution
    Added two methods to the SystemParamState trait, which gives the access used by the parameter. Did the implementation. Added some convenience methods to FilteredAccessSet. Changed `get_conflicts` to return every conflicting component instead of breaking on the first conflicting `FilteredAccess`.

    Fix gamepad connection system ordering (#4313)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Part of the splitting process of #3692.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Change the `gamepad_connection_system` to run after the `InputSystem` label.
    
    ## Reasons
    
    I changed the `gamepad_connection_system` to run after the `InputSystem` instead of in parallel, because this system checks the `GamepadEvent`s which get send inside of the `gamepad_event_system`. This means that the `gamepad_connection_system` could respond to the events one frame later, instead of instantly resulting in one frame lag.
    
    Old possible case:
    1. `gamepad_connection_system` (reacts to the `GamepadEvent`s too early)
    2. `gamepad_event_system` (sends the `GamepadEvent`s)
    
    New fixed ordering:
    1. `gamepad_event_system` (sends the `GamepadEvent`s)
    2. `gamepad_connection_system` (reacts to the `GamepadEvent`s)

    Remove `margins.rs` (#4284)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Closes #335.
    - Part of the splitting process of #3503.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the `margins.rs` file containing the `Margins` type.
    
    ## Reasons
    
    - It is unused inside of `bevy`.
    - The `Rect`/`UiRect` is identical to the `Margins` type and is also used for margins inside of `bevy` (rename of `Rect` happens in #4276)
    - Discussion in #3503.
    
    ## Changelog
    
    ### Removed
    
    - The `Margins` type got removed.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    - The `Margins` type got removed. To migrate you just have to change every occurrence of `Margins` to `UiRect`.

    Only insert or remove input if needed (#4273)
    
    # Objective
    
    We are currently inserting an `input` into `pressed` even if it is already pressed. This also applies to releasing an input. This is not a big deal, but since we are already checking if the `input` is pressed or not we might as well remove the cost of the value update caused by the `pressed.insert` method.
    
    Related to #4209
    
    ## Solution
    
    Only insert or remove input if needed.

    use error scope to handle errors on shader module creation (#3675)
    
    related: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3289
    
    In addition to validating shaders early when debug assertions are enabled, use the new [error scopes](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#error-scopes) API when creating a shader module.
    
    I chose to keep the early validation (and thereby parsing twice) when debug assertions are enabled in, because it lets as handle errors ourselves and display them with pretty colors, while the error scopes API just gives us a string we can display.
    
    
    
    This change pulls in `futures-util` as a new dependency for `future.now_or_never()`. I can inline that part of futures-lite into `bevy_render` to keep the compilation time lower if that's preferred.

    Introduce `SystemLabel`'s for `RenderAssetPlugin`, and change `Image` preparation system to run before others (#3917)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes `StandardMaterial` texture update (see sample code below).
    
    Most probably fixes #3674 (did not test)
    
    ## Solution
    
    Material updates, such as PBR update, reference the underlying `GpuImage`. Like here: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/9a7852db0f22eb41f259a1afbb4926eb73863a10/crates/bevy_pbr/src/pbr_material.rs#L177
    
    However, currently the `GpuImage` update may actually happen *after* the material update fetches the gpu image. Resulting in the material actually not being updated for the correct gpu image.
    
    In this pull req, I introduce new systemlabels for the renderassetplugin. Also assigned the RenderAssetPlugin::<Image> to the `PreAssetExtract` stage, so that it is executed before any material updates.
    
    Code to test.
    
    Expected behavior:
    * should update to red texture
    
    Unexpected behavior (before this merge):
    * texture stays randomly as green one (depending on the execution order of systems)

    Mesh Skinning. Attempt #3 (#4238)
    
    # Objective
    Load skeletal weights and indices from GLTF files. Animate meshes.
    
    ## Solution
     - Load skeletal weights and indices from GLTF files.
     - Added `SkinnedMesh` component and ` SkinnedMeshInverseBindPose` asset
     - Added `extract_skinned_meshes` to extract joint matrices.
     - Added queue phase systems for enqueuing the buffer writes.
    
    Some notes:
    
     -  This ports part of # #2359 to the current main.
     -  This generates new `BufferVec`s and bind groups every frame. The expectation here is that the number of `Query::get` calls during extract is probably going to be the stronger bottleneck, with up to 256 calls per skinned mesh. Until that is optimized, caching buffers and bind groups is probably a non-concern.
     - Unfortunately, due to the uniform size requirements, this means a 16KB buffer is allocated for every skinned mesh every frame. There's probably a few ways to get around this, but most of them require either compute shaders or storage buffers, which are both incompatible with WebGL2.

    - Get rid of the `changed_transform_query` entirely
    - `transform_propagate_system` execution time for `many_cubes -- sphere` dropped from 1.07ms to 0.159ms, an 85% reduction for this system. Frame rate increased from ~42fps to ~44fps

    bevy_derive: Add derives for `Deref` and `DerefMut` (#4328)
    
    # Objective
    
    A common pattern in Rust is the [newtype](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html). This is an especially useful pattern in Bevy as it allows us to give common/foreign types different semantics (such as allowing it to implement `Component` or `FromWorld`) or to simply treat them as a "new type" (clever). For example, it allows us to wrap a common `Vec<String>` and do things like:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component)]
    struct Items(Vec<String>);
    
    fn give_sword(query: Query<&mut Items>) {
      query.single_mut().0.push(String::from("Flaming Poisoning Raging Sword of Doom"));
    }
    ```
    
    > We could then define another struct that wraps `Vec<String>` without anything clashing in the query.
    
    However, one of the worst parts of this pattern is the ugly `.0` we have to write in order to access the type we actually care about. This is why people often implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` in order to get around this.
    
    Since it's such a common pattern, especially for Bevy, it makes sense to add a derive macro to automatically add those implementations.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added a derive macro for `Deref` and another for `DerefMut` (both exported into the prelude). This works on all structs (including tuple structs) as long as they only contain a single field:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Deref)]
    struct Foo(String);
    
    #[derive(Deref, DerefMut)]
    struct Bar {
      name: String,
    }
    ```
    
    This allows us to then remove that pesky `.0`:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component, Deref, DerefMut)]
    struct Items(Vec<String>);
    
    fn give_sword(query: Query<&mut Items>) {
      query.single_mut().push(String::from("Flaming Poisoning Raging Sword of Doom"));
    }
    ```
    
    ### Alternatives
    
    There are other alternatives to this such as by using the [`derive_more`](https://crates.io/crates/derive_more) crate. However, it doesn't seem like we need an entire crate just yet since we only need `Deref` and `DerefMut` (for now).
    
    ### Considerations
    
    One thing to consider is that the Rust std library recommends _not_ using `Deref` and `DerefMut` for things like this: "`Deref` should only be implemented for smart pointers to avoid confusion" ([reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html)). Personally, I believe it makes sense to use it in the way described above, but others may disagree.

    ## Changelog
    
    - Add `Deref` derive macro (exported to prelude)
    - Add `DerefMut` derive macro (exported to prelude)
    - Updated most newtypes in examples to use one or both derives

    Clean up Breakout logic (#4311)
    
    # Objective
    
    1. Spawning walls in the Breakout example was hard to follow and error-prone.
    2. The strategy used in `paddle_movement_system` was somewhat convoluted.
    3. Correctly modifying the size of the arena was hard, due to implicit coupling between the bounds and the bounds that the paddle can move in.
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. Refactor this to use a WallBundle struct with a builder; neatly demonstrating some essential patterns along the way.
    2. Use clamp and avoid using weird &mut strategies.
    3. Refactor logic to allow users to tweak the brick size, and automatically adjust the number of rows and columns to match.
    4. Make the brick layout more like classic breakout!

    Always update clusters and remove per-frame allocations (#4169)
    
     * Refactor assign_lights_to_clusters to always clear + update clusters, even if the screen size isn't available yet / is zero. This fixes #4167. We still avoid the "expensive" per-light work when the screen size isn't available yet. I also consolidated some logic to eliminate some redundancies.
    * Removed _a ton_ of (potentially very large) per-frame reallocations
      * Removed `Res<VisiblePointLights>` (a vec) in favor of  `Res<GlobalVisiblePointLights>` (a hashmap). We were allocating a new hashmap every frame, the collecting it into a vec every frame, then in another system _re-generating the hashmap_. It is always used like a hashmap, might as well embrace that. We now reuse the same hashmap every frame and dont use any intermediate collections.
      * We were re-allocating Clusters aabb and light vectors every frame by re-constructing Clusters every frame. We now re-use the existing collections.
      * Reuse per-camera VisiblePointLight vecs when possible instead of allocating them every frame. We now only insert VisiblePointLights if the component doesn't exist yet.

    Auto-label function systems with SystemTypeIdLabel (#4224)
    
    This adds the concept of "default labels" for systems (currently scoped to "parallel systems", but this could just as easily be implemented for "exclusive systems"). Function systems now include their function's `SystemTypeIdLabel` by default.
    
    This enables the following patterns:
    
    ```rust
    // ordering two systems without manually defining labels
    app
      .add_system(update_velocity)
      .add_system(movement.after(update_velocity))
    
    // ordering sets of systems without manually defining labels
    app
      .add_system(foo)
      .add_system_set(
        SystemSet::new()
          .after(foo)
          .with_system(bar)
          .with_system(baz)

    Break out Breakout components into a more sensible organization (#4261)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The components in the Breakout game are defined in a strange fashion.
       - Components should decouple behavior wherever possible.
       - Systems should be as general as possible, to make extending behavior easier.
       - Marker components are idiomatic and useful, but marker components and query filters were not used.
    - The existing design makes it challenging for beginners to extend the example into a high-quality game.

    - Refactor component definitions in the Breakout example to reflect principles above.
    
    ## Context

    Compute Pipeline Specialization (#3979)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #3970
    - To support Bevy's shader abstraction(shader defs, shader imports and hot shader reloading) for compute shaders, I have followed carts advice and change the `PipelinenCache` to accommodate both compute and render pipelines.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - renamed `RenderPipelineCache` to `PipelineCache`
    - Cached Pipelines are now represented by an enum (render, compute)
    - split the `SpecializedPipelines` into `SpecializedRenderPipelines` and `SpecializedComputePipelines`
    - updated the game of life example
    
    ## Open Questions
    
    - should `SpecializedRenderPipelines` and `SpecializedComputePipelines` be merged and how would we do that?
    - should the `get_render_pipeline` and `get_compute_pipeline` methods be merged?
    - is pipeline specialization for different entry points a good pattern

    Add a helper for storage buffers similar to `UniformVec` (#4079)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add a helper for storage buffers similar to `UniformVec`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `StorageBuffer<T, U>` where `T` is the main body of the shader struct without any final variable-sized array member, and `U` is the type of the items in a variable-sized array.
    - Use `()` as the type for unwanted parts, e.g. `StorageBuffer<(), Vec4>::default()` would construct a binding that would work with `struct MyType { data: array<vec4<f32>>; }` in WGSL and `StorageBuffer<MyType, ()>::default()` would work with `struct MyType { ... }` in WGSL as long as there are no variable-sized arrays.
    - Std430 requires that there is at most one variable-sized array in a storage buffer, that if there is one it is the last member of the binding, and that it has at least one item. `StorageBuffer` handles all of these constraints.

    yeet unsound lifetime annotations on `Query` methods (#4243)
    
    # Objective
    Continuation of #2964 (I really should have checked other methods when I made that PR)
    
    yeet unsound lifetime annotations on `Query` methods.
    Example unsoundness:
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    
    fn main() {
        App::new().add_startup_system(bar).add_system(foo).run();
    }
    
    pub fn bar(mut cmds: Commands) {
        let e = cmds.spawn().insert(Foo { a: 10 }).id();
        cmds.insert_resource(e);
    }
    
    #[derive(Component, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
    pub struct Foo {
        a: u32,
    }
    pub fn foo(mut query: Query<&mut Foo>, e: Res<Entity>) {
        dbg!("hi");
        {
            let data: &Foo = query.get(*e).unwrap();
            let data2: Mut<Foo> = query.get_mut(*e).unwrap();

        }
    
        {

    Gltf animations (#3751)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Load informations for animations from GLTF
    - Make experimenting on animations easier
    
    # Non Objective
    
    - Implement a solutions for all animations in Bevy. This would need a discussion / RFC. The goal here is only to have the information available to try different APIs
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Load animations with a representation close to the GLTF spec
    - Add an example to display animations. There is an animation driver in the example, not in Bevy code, to show how it can be used. The example is cycling between examples from the official gltf sample ([AnimatedTriangle](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/AnimatedTriangle), [BoxAnimated](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/BoxAnimated)), and one from me with some cases not present in the official examples.

    bevy_render: Support removal of nodes, edges, subgraphs (#3048)
    
    Add support for removing nodes, edges, and subgraphs. This enables live re-wiring of the render graph.
    
    This was something I did to support the MSAA implementation, but it turned out to be unnecessary there. However, it is still useful so here it is in its own PR.

    Add transform hierarchy stress test (#4170)
    
    ## Objective
    
    There recently was a discussion on Discord about a possible test case for stress-testing transform hierarchies.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Create a test case for stress testing transform propagation.
    
    *Edit:* I have scrapped my previous example and built something more functional and less focused on visuals.
    
    There are three test setups:
    
    - `TestCase::Tree` recursively creates a tree with a specified depth and branch width
    - `TestCase::NonUniformTree` is the same as `Tree` but omits nodes in a way that makes the tree "lean" towards one side, like this:
      <details>
      <summary></summary>
    
      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3957610/158069737-2ddf4e4a-7d5c-4ee5-8566-424a54a06723.png)
      </details>
    - `TestCase::Humanoids` creates one or more separate hierarchies based on the structure of common humanoid rigs
      - this can both insert `active` and `inactive` instances of the human rig
    
    It's possible to parameterize which parts of the hierarchy get updated (transform change) and which remain unchanged. This is based on @james7132 suggestion:
    There's a probability to decide which entities should remain static. On top of that these changes can be limited to a certain range in the hierarchy (min_depth..max_depth).

    # Objective
    
    As described in  #4257, registering an Event twice would cause some systems to miss events on some starts, since the event buffer is cleared + swapped multiple times.
    
    Fixes #4257
    
    ## Solution
    
    A simple check whether the event is already registered is added, making adding an Event a second time a no-op.

    gltf-loader: disable backface culling if material is double-sided (#4270)
    
    # Objective
    
    The  [glTF spec](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/8e798b02d254cea97659a333cfcb20875b62bdd4/specification/2.0/Specification.adoc#395-double-sided) the `doubleSided` has the following to say about the `doubleSided` boolean:
    
    > When this value is false, back-face culling is enabled, i.e., only front-facing triangles are rendered.
    > When this value is true, back-face culling is disabled and double sided lighting is enabled. The back-face MUST have its normals reversed before the lighting equation is evaluated.
    
    ## Solution
    Disable backface culling when `doubleSided: true`.

    # Objective
    
    - Allow quick and easy testing of scenes
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `scene-viewer` tool based on `load_gltf`.
      - Run it with e.g. `cargo run --release --example scene_viewer --features jpeg -- ../some/path/assets/models/Sponza/glTF/Sponza.gltf#Scene0`
    - Configure the asset path as pointing to the repo root for convenience (paths specified relative to current working directory)
    - Copy over the camera controller from the `shadow_biases` example
    - Support toggling the light animation
    - Support toggling shadows
    - Support adjusting the directional light shadow projection (cascaded shadow maps will remove the need for this later)
    
    I don't want to do too much on it up-front. Rather we can add features over time as we need them.

    Revert "Add cart's fork of ecs_bench_suite (#4225)" (#4252)
    
    This reverts commit 08ef2f0a2841bd5aa0ef01ed711744a7ede9eb42.
    
    # Objective
    
    - #4225 was merged without considering the licensing considerations.
    - It merges in code taken from https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench_suite/tree/bevy-benches/src/bevy.
    - We can safely assume that we do have a license to cart's contributions. However, these build upon https://github.com/cart/ecs_bench_suite/commit/377e96e69ab99e3de270fc9a158aafa1ca3ad3a3, for which we have no license.
    - This has been verified by looking in the Cargo.toml, the root folder and the readme, none of which mention a license. Additionally, the string "license" [doesn't appear](https://github.com/rust-gamedev/ecs_bench_suite/search?q=license) in the repository.
    - This means the code is all rights reserved.
    - (The author of these commits also hasn't commented in #2373, though even if they had, it would be legally *dubious* to rely on that to license any code they ever wrote)
    - (Note that the latest commit on the head at https://github.com/rust-gamedev/ecs_bench_suite hasn't had a license added either.)
    - We are currently incorrectly claiming to be able to give an MIT/Apache 2.0 license to this code.

    Faster view frustum culling (#4181)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Reduce time spent in the `check_visibility` system
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use `Vec3A` for all bounding volume types to leverage SIMD optimisations and to avoid repeated runtime conversions from `Vec3` to `Vec3A`
    - Inline all bounding volume intersection methods
    - Add on-the-fly calculated `Aabb` -> `Sphere` and do `Sphere`-`Frustum` intersection tests before `Aabb`-`Frustum` tests. This is faster for `many_cubes` but could be slower in other cases where the sphere test gives a false-positive that the `Aabb` test discards. Also, I tested precalculating the `Sphere`s and inserting them alongside the `Aabb` but this was slower.
    - Do not test meshes against the far plane. Apparently games don't do this anymore with infinite projections, and it's one fewer plane to test against. I made it optional and still do the test for culling lights but that is up for discussion.
    - These collectively reduce `check_visibility` execution time in `many_cubes -- sphere` from 2.76ms to 1.48ms and increase frame rate from ~42fps to ~44fps

    Use more ergonomic span syntax (#4246)
    
    Tracing added support for "inline span entering", which cuts down on a lot of complexity:
    
    ```rust
    let span = info_span!("my_span").entered();

    Add "Changelog" and "Migration Guide" to PR template (#4143)
    
    # Objective
    
    Context: [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/745355529777315850/950532143325519902)
    
    Improve the PR template by adding "Changelog" and "Migration Guide" sections. These sections should hopefully help speed up the review/merge process, as well as help make release notes and migration guides.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added the "Changelog" section template which suggests listing out the changes of the PR. This also acts as a sort of tl;dr for reviewers (especially for larger PRs).
    
    Added the "Migration Guide" section template which suggests describing how a user might need to migrate their codebase to account for the changes by the PR. This also helps authors/contributors keep the end-user in mind when adding or changing the API.
    
    Both sections are optional— an author does not _need_ to fill these out. Hopefully they will, though, as it provides a handful of really great benefits.

    Render to texture example: No need to create an image handle manually. (#4223)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make the example a little easier to follow by removing unnecessary steps.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `Assets<Image>` will give us a handle for our render texture if we call `add()` instead of `set()`.  No need to set it manually; one less thing to think about while reading the example.

    Add automatic docs deployment to GitHub Pages (#3535)
    
    # Objective
    
    Partially address #407 by setting up automated deployments of `bevy`'s API reference to GitHub Pages.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the docs on every push to `main` and pushes a new commit to a `gh-pages` (or `docs` branch).
    
    A few smaller additions to better address #407:
    
     - A top level redirect was added to take "docs.bevyengine.org" directly to the `bevy` crate docs.
     - A GitHub Pages CNAME file for supporting a publicly viewable domain instead of `github.io`
     - A robots.txt file is added to disable all search engine crawlers that respect it from crawling it (avoid having conflicting Google search results)
     - A .nojekyl file to speed up deployments since there is no Jekyll templating in the output.
    
    This may require configuration of the  `GITHUB_TOKEN` of the CI to successfully run this.
    
    ## Followup
    
    For this to completely resolve #407, a subdomain of https://bevyengine.org/ needs to be set up to point to the CNAME location. This is initially set to "dev-docs.bevyengine.org".

    KTX2/DDS/.basis compressed texture support (#3884)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Support compressed textures including 'universal' formats (ETC1S, UASTC) and transcoding of them to
    - Support `.dds`, `.ktx2`, and `.basis` files
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3608 Look there for more details.
    - Note that the functionality is all enabled through non-default features. If it is desirable to enable some by default, I can do that.
    - The `basis-universal` crate, used for `.basis` file support and for transcoding, is built on bindings against a C++ library. It's not feasible to rewrite in Rust in a short amount of time. There are no Rust alternatives of which I am aware and it's specialised code. In its current state it doesn't support the wasm target, but I don't know for sure. However, it is possible to build the upstream C++ library with emscripten, so there is perhaps a way to add support for web too with some shenanigans.
    - There's no support for transcoding from BasisLZ/ETC1S in KTX2 files as it was quite non-trivial to implement and didn't feel important given people could use `.basis` files for ETC1S.

    Split bevy_hierarchy out from bevy_transform (#4168)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Hierarchy tools are not just used for `Transform`: they are also used for scenes.
    - In the future there's interest in using them for other features, such as visiibility inheritance.
    - The fact that these tools are found in `bevy_transform` causes a great deal of user and developer confusion
    - Fixes #2758.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Split `bevy_transform` into two!
    - Make everything work again.
    
    Note that this is a very tightly scoped PR: I *know* there are code quality and docs issues that existed in bevy_transform that I've just moved around. We should fix those in a seperate PR and try to merge this ASAP to reduce the bitrot involved in splitting an entire crate.
    
    ## Frustrations
    
    The API around `GlobalTransform` is a mess: we have massive code and docs duplication, no link between the two types and no clear way to extend this to other forms of inheritance.
    
    In the medium-term, I feel pretty strongly that `GlobalTransform` should be replaced by something like `Inherited<Transform>`, which lives in `bevy_hierarchy`:
    
    - avoids code duplication
    - makes the inheritance pattern extensible
    - links the types at the type-level
    - allows us to remove all references to inheritance from `bevy_transform`, making it more useful as a standalone crate and cleaning up its docs
    
    ## Additional context
    
    - double-blessed by @cart in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4141#issuecomment-1063592414 and https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2758#issuecomment-913810963
    - preparation for more advanced / cleaner hierarchy tools: go read https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/53 !
    - originally attempted by @finegeometer in #2789. It was a great idea, just needed more discussion!

    use marker components for cameras instead of name strings (#3635)
    
    **Problem**
    - whenever you want more than one of the builtin cameras (for example multiple windows, split screen, portals), you need to add a render graph node that executes the correct sub graph, extract the camera into the render world and add the correct `RenderPhase<T>` components
    - querying for the 3d camera is annoying because you need to compare the camera's name to e.g. `CameraPlugin::CAMERA_3d`
    
    **Solution**
    - Introduce the marker types `Camera3d`, `Camera2d` and `CameraUi`
    -> `Query<&mut Transform, With<Camera3d>>` works
    - `PerspectiveCameraBundle::new_3d()` and `PerspectiveCameraBundle::<Camera3d>::default()` contain the `Camera3d` marker
    - `OrthographicCameraBundle::new_3d()` has `Camera3d`, `OrthographicCameraBundle::new_2d()` has `Camera2d`
    - remove `ActiveCameras`, `ExtractedCameraNames`
    - run 2d, 3d and ui passes for every camera of their respective marker
    -> no custom setup for multiple windows example needed
    
    **Open questions**
    - do we need a replacement for `ActiveCameras`? What about a component `ActiveCamera { is_active: bool }` similar to `Visibility`?

    fix cluster tilesize and tilecount calculations.
    Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/4127 & https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3596
    
    ## Solution
    
    - calculate tilesize as smallest integers such that dimensions.xy() tiles will cover the screen
    - calculate final dimensions as smallest integers such that final dimensions * tilesize will cover the screen
    
    there is more cleanup that could be done in these functions. a future PR will likely remove the tilesize completely, so this is just a minimal change set to fix the current bug at small screen sizes

    # Objective
    
    Fixes #4036
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use `VertexBufferLayout::from_vertex_formats`
    - Actually put a u32 into `ATTRIBUTE_COLOR` and convert it in the shader
    
    I'm not 100% sure about the color stuff. It seems like `ATTRIBUTE_COLOR` has been `Uint32` this whole time, but this example previously worked with `[f32; 4]` somehow, perhaps because the vertex layout was manually specified.
    
    Let me know if that can be improved, or feel free to close for an alternative fix.

    fix mul_vec3 tranformation order: should be scale -> rotate -> translate (#3811)
    
    # Objective
    
    Lets say we need to rotate stretched object for this purpose we can created stretched `Child` and add as child to `Parent`, later we can rotate `Parent`, `Child` in this situation should rotate keeping it form, it is not the case with `SpriteBundle` currently. If you try to do it with `SpriteBundle` it will deform.
    
    ## Solution
    
    My pull request fixes order of transformations to scale -> rotate -> translate, with this fix `SpriteBundle` behaves as expected in described rotation, without deformation. Here is quote from "Essential Mathematics for Games":
    
    > Generally, the desired order we wish to use for these transforms is to scale first, then rotate, then translate. Scaling first gives us the scaling along the axes we expect. We can then rotate around the origin of the frame, and then translate it into place.
    
    I'm must say when I was using `MaterialMesh2dBundle` it behaves correctly in both cases with `bevy main` and with my fix, don't know why, was not able to figure it out why there is difference.
    
    here is code I was using for testing:
    ```rust
    use bevy::{
        prelude::*,
        render::render_resource::{Extent3d, TextureDimension, TextureFormat},
        sprite::{MaterialMesh2dBundle, Mesh2dHandle},
    };
    
    fn main() {
        let mut app = App::new();
        app.insert_resource(ClearColor(Color::rgb(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)))
            .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)
            .add_startup_system(setup);
        app.run();
    }

        mut commands: Commands,
        mut images: ResMut<Assets<Image>>,
        mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,

        let mut c = OrthographicCameraBundle::new_2d();
        c.orthographic_projection.scale = 1.0 / 10.0;
        commands.spawn_bundle(c);
        // note: mesh somehow works for both variants
        // let quad: Mesh2dHandle = meshes.add(Mesh::from(shape::Quad::default())).into();
        // let child = commands
        //     .spawn_bundle(MaterialMesh2dBundle {

    Dynamic light clusters (#3968)
    
    # Objective
    
    provide some customisation for default cluster setup
    avoid "cluster index lists is full" in all cases (using a strategy outlined by @superdump)
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add ClusterConfig enum (which can be inserted into a view at any time) to allow specifying cluster setup with variants:
    - None (do not do any light assignment - for views which do not require light info, e.g. minimaps etc)
    - Single (one cluster)
    - XYZ (explicit cluster counts in each dimension)
    - FixedZ (most similar to current - specify Z-slices and total, then x and y counts are dynamically determined to give approximately square clusters based on current aspect ratio)
    Defaults to FixedZ { total: 4096, z: 24 } which is similar to the current setup.
    
    Per frame, estimate the number of indices that would be required for the current config and decrease the cluster counts / increase the cluster sizes in the x and y dimensions if the index list would be too small.
    
    notes:
    
    - I didn't put ClusterConfig in the camera bundles to avoid introducing a dependency from bevy_render to bevy_pbr. the ClusterConfig enum comes with a pbr-centric impl block so i didn't want to move that into bevy_render either.
    - ~Might want to add None variant to cluster config for views that don't care about lights?~
    - Not well tested for orthographic
    - ~there's a cluster_muck branch on my repo which includes some diagnostics / a modified lighting example which may be useful for tyre-kicking~ (outdated, i will bring it up to date if required)
    
    anecdotal timings:
    
    FPS on the lighting demo is negligibly better (~5%), maybe due to a small optimisation constraining the light aabb to be in front of the camera
    FPS on the lighting demo with 100 extra lights added is ~33% faster, and also renders correctly as the cluster index count is no longer exceeded

    many_cubes: Add a cube pattern suitable for benchmarking culling changes (#4126)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add a cube pattern to `many_cubes` suitable for benchmarking culling changes
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use a 'golden spiral' mapped to a sphere with the strategy of optimising for average nearest neighbour distance, as per: http://extremelearning.com.au/how-to-evenly-distribute-points-on-a-sphere-more-effectively-than-the-canonical-fibonacci-lattice/

    Fix UI node Transform change detection (#4138)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #4133
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add comparisons to make sure we don't dereference `Mut<>` in the two places where `Transform` is being mutated. `GlobalTransform` implementation already works properly so fixing Transform automatically fixed that as well.

    perf: only recalculate frusta of changed lights (#4086)
    
    ## Objective
    
    Currently, all directional and point lights have their viewing frusta recalculated every frame, even if they have not moved or been disabled/enabled.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The relevant systems now make use of change detection to only update those lights whose viewing frusta may have changed.

    Add docs and common helper functions to `Windows` (#4107)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Improve documentation.
    - Provide helper functions for common uses of `Windows` relating to getting the primary `Window`.
    - Reduce repeated `Window` code.
    
    # Solution
    
    - Adds infallible `primary()` and `primary_mut()` functions with standard error text. This replaces the commonly used `get_primary().unwrap()` seen throughout bevy which has inconsistent or nonexistent error messages.
    - Adds `scale_factor(WindowId)` to replace repeated code blocks throughout.
    
    # Considerations
    
    - The added functions can panic if the primary window does not exist.
        - It is very uncommon for the primary window to not exist, as seen by the regular use of `get_primary().unwrap()`. Most users will have a single window and will need to reference the primary window in their code multiple times.
        - The panic provides a consistent error message to make this class of error easy to spot from the panic text.
        - This follows the established standard of short names for infallible-but-unlikely-to-panic functions in bevy.
    - Removes line noise for common usage of `Windows`.

    Fixed the frustum-sphere collision and added tests (#4035)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #3744
    
    ## Solution
    
    The old code used the formula `normal . center + d + radius <= 0` to determine if the sphere with center `center` and radius `radius` is outside the plane with normal `normal` and distance from origin `d`. This only works if `normal` is normalized, which is not necessarily the case. Instead, `normal` and `d` are both multiplied by some factor that `radius` isn't multiplied by. So the additional code multiplied `radius` by that factor.

    Add Reflect support for DMat3, DMat4, DQuat (#4128)
    
    ## Objective
    
    A step towards `f64` `Transform`s (#1680). For now, I am rolling my own `Transform`. But in order to derive Reflect, I specifically need `DQuat` to be reflectable.
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Component, Reflect, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Debug)]
    #[reflect(Component, PartialEq)]
    pub struct Transform {
        pub translation: DVec3,
        pub rotation: DQuat, // error: the trait `bevy::prelude::Reflect` is not implemented for `DQuat`
        pub scale: DVec3,
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    I have added a `DQuat` impl for `Reflect` alongside the other glam impls. I've also added impls for `DMat3` and `DMat4` to match.

    Reduce power usage with configurable event loop (#3974)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Reduce power usage for games when not focused.
    - Reduce power usage to ~0 when a desktop application is minimized (opt-in).
    - Reduce power usage when focused, only updating on a `winit` event, or the user sends a redraw request. (opt-in)
    
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2632925/156904387-ec47d7de-7f06-4c6f-8aaf-1e952c1153a2.mp4
    
    Note resource usage in the Task Manager in the above video.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added a type `UpdateMode` that allows users to specify how the winit event loop is updated, without exposing winit types.
    - Added two fields to `WinitConfig`, both with the `UpdateMode` type. One configures how the application updates when focused, and the other configures how the application behaves when it is not focused. Users can modify this resource manually to set the type of event loop control flow they want.
    - For convenience, two functions were added to `WinitConfig`, that provide reasonable presets: `game()` (default) and `desktop_app()`.
        - The `game()` preset, which is used by default, is unchanged from current behavior with one exception: when the app is out of focus the app updates at a minimum of 10fps, or every time a winit event is received. This has a huge positive impact on power use and responsiveness on my machine, which will otherwise continue running the app at many hundreds of fps when out of focus or minimized.
        - The `desktop_app()` preset is fully reactive, only updating when user input (winit event) is supplied or a `RedrawRequest` event is sent. When the app is out of focus, it only updates on `Window` events - i.e. any winit event that directly interacts with the window. What this means in practice is that the app uses *zero* resources when minimized or not interacted with, but still updates fluidly when the app is out of focus and the user mouses over the application.
    - Added a `RedrawRequest` event so users can force an update even if there are no events. This is useful in an application when you want to, say, run an animation even when the user isn't providing input.
    - Added an example `low_power` to demonstrate these changes
    
    ## Usage
    
    Configuring the event loop:
    ```rs
    use bevy::winit::{WinitConfig};
    // ...
    .insert_resource(WinitConfig::desktop_app()) // preset
    // or
    .insert_resource(WinitConfig::game()) // preset
    // or
    .insert_resource(WinitConfig{ .. }) // manual
    ```
    
    Requesting a redraw:
    ```rs
    use bevy::window::RequestRedraw;
    // ...
    fn request_redraw(mut event: EventWriter<RequestRedraw>) {
        event.send(RequestRedraw);
    }
    ```
    
    ## Other details
    
    - Because we have a single event loop for multiple windows, every time I've mentioned "focused" above, I more precisely mean, "if at least one bevy window is focused".
    - Due to a platform bug in winit (https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1619), we can't simply use `Window::request_redraw()`. As a workaround, this PR will temporarily set the window mode to `Poll` when a redraw is requested. This is then reset to the user's `WinitConfig` setting on the next frame.

    improve error messages for render graph runner (#3930)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, errors in the render graph runner are exposed via a `Result::unwrap()` panic message, which dumps the debug representation of the error.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR updates `render_system` to log the chain of errors, followed by an explicit panic:
    
    ```
    ERROR bevy_render::renderer: Error running render graph:
    ERROR bevy_render::renderer: > encountered an error when running a sub-graph
    ERROR bevy_render::renderer: > tried to pass inputs to sub-graph "outline_graph", which has no input slots
    thread 'main' panicked at 'Error running render graph: encountered an error when running a sub-graph', /[redacted]/bevy/crates/bevy_render/src/renderer/mod.rs:44:9
    ```
    
    Some errors' `Display` impls (via `thiserror`) have also been updated to provide more detail about the cause of the error.

    `iter_mut` on Assets: send modified event only when asset is iterated over (#3565)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `Assets<T>::iter_mut` sends `Modified` event for all assets first, then returns the iterator
    - This means that events could be sent for assets that would not have been mutated if iteration was stopped before
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Send `Modified` event when assets are iterated over.

    StandardMaterial: expose a cull_mode option (#3982)
    
    This makes it possible for materials to configure front or
    back face culling, or disable culling.
    
    Initially I looked at specializing the Mesh which currently
    controls this state but conceptually it seems more appropriate
    to control this at the material level, not the mesh level.
    
    _Just for reference this also seems to be consistent with Unity
    where materials/shaders can configure the culling mode between
    front/back/off - as opposed to configuring any culling state
    when importing a mesh._
    
    After some archaeology, trying to understand how this might
    relate to the existing 'double_sided' option, it was determined
    that double_sided is a more high level lighting option originally
    from Filament that will cause the normals for back faces to be
    flipped.
    
    For sake of avoiding complexity, but keeping control this
    currently keeps the options orthogonal, and adds some clarifying
    documentation for `double_sided`. This won't affect any existing
    apps since there hasn't been a way to disable backface culling
    up until now, so the option was essentially redundant.
    
    double_sided support could potentially be updated to imply
    disabling of backface culling.
    
    For reference https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3734/commits also looks at exposing cull mode control. I think the main difference here is that this patch handles RenderPipelineDescriptor specialization directly within the StandardMaterial implementation instead of communicating info back to the Mesh via the `queue_material_meshes` system.
    
    With the way material.rs builds up the final RenderPipelineDescriptor first by calling specialize for the MeshPipeline followed by specialize for the material then it seems like we have a natural place to override anything in the descriptor that's first configured for the mesh state.

    Example of module-level log usage and RUST_LOG usage in main doc (#3919)
    
    # Objective
    
    When developing plugins, I very often come up to the need to have logging information printed out. The exact syntax is a bit cryptic, and takes some time to find the documentation.
    
    Also a minor typo fix in `It has the same syntax as` part
    
    ## Solution
    
    Adding a direct example in the module level information for both:
    
    1. Enabling a specific level (`trace` in the example) for a module and all its subsystems at App init
    2. Doing the same from console, when launching the application

    default() shorthand (#4071)
    
    Adds a `default()` shorthand for `Default::default()` ... because life is too short to constantly type `Default::default()`.
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    
    #[derive(Default)]
    struct Foo {
      bar: usize,
      baz: usize,
    }
    
    // Normally you would do this:
    let foo = Foo {
      bar: 10,
      ..Default::default()
    };
    
    // But now you can do this:
    let foo = Foo {
      bar: 10,
      ..default()
    };
    ```
    
    The examples have been adapted to use `..default()`. I've left internal crates as-is for now because they don't pull in the bevy prelude, and the ergonomics of each case should be considered individually.

    fix issues with too many point lights (#3916)
    
    # Objective
    
    fix #3915
    
    ## Solution
    
    the issues are caused by
    - lights are assigned to clusters before being filtered down to MAX_POINT_LIGHTS, leading to cluster counts potentially being too high
    - after fixing the above, packing the count into 8 bits still causes overflow with exactly 256 lights affecting a cluster
    
    to fix:
    
    ```assign_lights_to_clusters```
    - limit extracted lights to MAX_POINT_LIGHTS, selecting based on shadow-caster & intensity (if required)
    - warn if MAX_POINT_LIGHT count is exceeded
    
    ```prepare_lights```
    - limit the lights assigned to a cluster to CLUSTER_COUNT_MASK (which is 1 less than MAX_POINT_LIGHTS) to avoid overflowing into the offset bits
    
    notes:
    - a better solution to the overflow may be to use more than 8 bits for cluster_count (the comment states only 14 of the remaining 24 bits are used for the offset). this would touch more of the code base but i'm happy to try if it has some benefit.
    - intensity is only one way to select lights. it may be worth allowing user configuration of the light filtering, but i can't see a clean way to do that

    examples: add screenspace texture shader example (#4063)
    
    Adds a new shader example showing how to sample a texture with screenspace coordinates, similar to the end [portal in minecraft](https://bugs.mojang.com/secure/attachment/163759/portal_frame_112.gif).

    I just used the already existent `models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet_Materials_LensesMat_OcclusionRoughMetal.png` texture but maybe we should use a dedicated texture for the example. Suggestions welcome.

    log spans on panic when trace is enabled (#3848)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Help debug panics
    
    ## Solution

    before:
    ```
    thread 'main' panicked at 'Could not add a component (of type `panic::Marker`) to entity 1v0 because it doesn't exist in this World.
    If this command was added to a newly spawned entity, ensure that you have not despawned that entity within the same stage.
    This may have occurred due to system order ambiguity, or if the spawning system has multiple command buffers', /bevy/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/commands/mod.rs:664:13
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

    bevy_pbr: Optimize assign_lights_to_clusters (#3984)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Optimize assign_lights_to_clusters
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Avoid inserting entities into hash sets in inner loops when it is known they will be inserted in at least one iteration of the loop.
    - Use a Vec instead of a hash set where the set is not needed
    - Avoid explicit calculation of the cluster_index from x,y,z coordinates, instead using row and column offsets and just adding z in the inner loop
    - These changes cut the time spent in the system roughly in half

    Expose draw indirect (#4056)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Currently there is now way of making an indirect draw call from a tracked render pass.
    - This is a very useful feature for GPU based rendering.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Expose the `draw_indirect` and `draw_indexed_indirect` methods from the wgpu `RenderPass` in the `TrackedRenderPass`.
    
    ## Alternative
    
    - #3595: Expose the underlying `RenderPass` directly

    Make get_resource (and friends) infallible (#4047)
    
    # Objective
    
    - In the large majority of cases, users were calling `.unwrap()` immediately after `.get_resource`.
    - Attempting to add more helpful error messages here resulted in endless manual boilerplate (see #3899 and the linked PRs).
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add an infallible variant named `.resource` and so on.
    - Use these infallible variants over `.get_resource().unwrap()` across the code base.
    
    ## Notes
    
    I did not provide equivalent methods on `WorldCell`, in favor of removing it entirely in #3939.
    
    ## Migration Guide
    
    Infallible variants of `.get_resource` have been added that implicitly panic, rather than needing to be unwrapped.
    
    Replace `world.get_resource::<Foo>().unwrap()` with `world.resource::<Foo>()`.
    
    ## Impact
    
    - `.unwrap` search results before: 1084
    - `.unwrap` search results after: 942
    - internal `unwrap_or_else` calls added: 4
    - trivial unwrap calls removed from tests and code: 146
    - uses of the new `try_get_resource` API: 11
    - percentage of the time the unwrapping API was used internally: 93%

    Minor Bevy Logo Tweaks (#4050)
    
    @BlackPhlox kindly pointed out and resolved a couple of inconsistencies in the bevy logo:
    * The arc of the first bird's back had three vertices right next to each other, which created a noticeable sharp edge. This replaces them with a single vertex.
    * The bottom part of the tail had a sharp edge, which was inconsistent with the top part of the tail. This was rounded out to mirror the top part.
    
    I also took the chance to clean up some of the variants and (hopefully) improve the "bevy_logo_light_dark_and_dimmed" variant to improve how it renders on dark themes.

    Mesh vertex buffer layouts (#3959)
    
    This PR makes a number of changes to how meshes and vertex attributes are handled, which the goal of enabling easy and flexible custom vertex attributes:
    * Reworks the `Mesh` type to use the newly added `VertexAttribute` internally
      * `VertexAttribute` defines the name, a unique `VertexAttributeId`, and a `VertexFormat`
      *  `VertexAttributeId` is used to produce consistent sort orders for vertex buffer generation, replacing the more expensive and often surprising "name based sorting"
      * Meshes can be used to generate a `MeshVertexBufferLayout`, which defines the layout of the gpu buffer produced by the mesh. `MeshVertexBufferLayouts` can then be used to generate actual `VertexBufferLayouts` according to the requirements of a specific pipeline. This decoupling of "mesh layout" vs "pipeline vertex buffer layout" is what enables custom attributes. We don't need to standardize _mesh layouts_ or contort meshes to meet the needs of a specific pipeline. As long as the mesh has what the pipeline needs, it will work transparently.
    * Mesh-based pipelines now specialize on `&MeshVertexBufferLayout` via the new `SpecializedMeshPipeline` trait (which behaves like `SpecializedPipeline`, but adds `&MeshVertexBufferLayout`). The integrity of the pipeline cache is maintained because the `MeshVertexBufferLayout` is treated as part of the key (which is fully abstracted from implementers of the trait ... no need to add any additional info to the specialization key).
    * Hashing `MeshVertexBufferLayout` is too expensive to do for every entity, every frame. To make this scalable, I added a generalized "pre-hashing" solution to `bevy_utils`: `Hashed<T>` keys and `PreHashMap<K, V>` (which uses `Hashed<T>` internally) . Why didn't I just do the quick and dirty in-place "pre-compute hash and use that u64 as a key in a hashmap" that we've done in the past? Because its wrong! Hashes by themselves aren't enough because two different values can produce the same hash. Re-hashing a hash is even worse! I decided to build a generalized solution because this pattern has come up in the past and we've chosen to do the wrong thing. Now we can do the right thing! This did unfortunately require pulling in `hashbrown` and using that in `bevy_utils`, because avoiding re-hashes requires the `raw_entry_mut` api, which isn't stabilized yet (and may never be ... `entry_ref` has favor now, but also isn't available yet). If std's HashMap ever provides the tools we need, we can move back to that. Note that adding `hashbrown` doesn't increase our dependency count because it was already in our tree. I will probably break these changes out into their own PR.
    * Specializing on `MeshVertexBufferLayout` has one non-obvious behavior: it can produce identical pipelines for two different MeshVertexBufferLayouts. To optimize the number of active pipelines / reduce re-binds while drawing, I de-duplicate pipelines post-specialization using the final `VertexBufferLayout` as the key.  For example, consider a pipeline that needs the layout `(position, normal)` and is specialized using two meshes: `(position, normal, uv)` and `(position, normal, other_vec2)`. If both of these meshes result in `(position, normal)` specializations, we can use the same pipeline! Now we do. Cool!
    
    To briefly illustrate, this is what the relevant section of `MeshPipeline`'s specialization code looks like now:
    
    ```rust
    impl SpecializedMeshPipeline for MeshPipeline {
        type Key = MeshPipelineKey;
    
        fn specialize(
            &self,
            key: Self::Key,
            layout: &MeshVertexBufferLayout,
        ) -> RenderPipelineDescriptor {
            let mut vertex_attributes = vec![
                Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION.at_shader_location(0),
                Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL.at_shader_location(1),
                Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_UV_0.at_shader_location(2),
            ];
    
            let mut shader_defs = Vec::new();
            if layout.contains(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_TANGENT) {
                shader_defs.push(String::from("VERTEX_TANGENTS"));
                vertex_attributes.push(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_TANGENT.at_shader_location(3));
            }
    
            let vertex_buffer_layout = layout
                .get_layout(&vertex_attributes)
                .expect("Mesh is missing a vertex attribute");
    ```
    
    Notice that this is _much_ simpler than it was before. And now any mesh with any layout can be used with this pipeline, provided it has vertex postions, normals, and uvs. We even got to remove `HAS_TANGENTS` from MeshPipelineKey and `has_tangents` from `GpuMesh`, because that information is redundant with `MeshVertexBufferLayout`.
    
    This is still a draft because I still need to:
    
    * Add more docs
    * Experiment with adding error handling to mesh pipeline specialization (which would print errors at runtime when a mesh is missing a vertex attribute required by a pipeline). If it doesn't tank perf, we'll keep it.
    * Consider breaking out the PreHash / hashbrown changes into a separate PR.
    * Add an example illustrating this change
    * Verify that the "mesh-specialized pipeline de-duplication code" works properly
    
    Please dont yell at me for not doing these things yet :) Just trying to get this in peoples' hands asap.

    Change default `ColorMaterial` color to white (#3981)
    
    # Context
    
    I wanted to add a `texture` to my `ColorMaterial` without explicitly adding a `color`. To do this I used `..Default::default()` which in turn gave me unexpected results. I was expecting that my texture would render without any color modifications, but to my surprise it got rendered in a purple tint (`Color::rgb(1.0, 0.0, 1.0)`). To fix this I had to explicitly define the `color` using `color: Color::WHITE`.
    
    ## What I wanted to use
    
    ```rust
    commands
        .spawn_bundle(MaterialMesh2dBundle {
            mesh: mesh_handle.clone().into(),
            transform: Transform::default().with_scale(Vec3::splat(8.)),
            material: materials.add(ColorMaterial {
                texture: Some(texture_handle.clone()),
                ..Default::default() // here
            }),
            ..Default::default()
        })
    ```

    ## What I had to use instead

        .spawn_bundle(MaterialMesh2dBundle {

    Internal Asset Hot Reloading (#3966)
    
    Adds "hot reloading" of internal assets, which is normally not possible because they are loaded using `include_str` / direct Asset collection access.
    
    This is accomplished via the following:
    * Add a new `debug_asset_server` feature flag
    * When that feature flag is enabled, create a second App with a second AssetServer that points to a configured location (by default the `crates` folder). Plugins that want to add hot reloading support for their assets can call the new `app.add_debug_asset::<T>()` and `app.init_debug_asset_loader::<T>()` functions.
    * Load "internal" assets using the new `load_internal_asset` macro. By default this is identical to the current "include_str + register in asset collection" approach. But if the `debug_asset_server` feature flag is enabled, it will also load the asset dynamically in the debug asset server using the file path. It will then set up a correlation between the "debug asset" and the "actual asset" by listening for asset change events.
    
    This is an alternative to #3673. The goal was to keep the boilerplate and features flags to a minimum for bevy plugin authors, and allow them to home their shaders near relevant code.
    
    This is a draft because I haven't done _any_ quality control on this yet. I'll probably rename things and remove a bunch of unwraps. I just got it working and wanted to use it to start a conversation.
    
    Fixes #3660

    Move import_path definitions into shader source (#3976)
    
    This enables shaders to (optionally) define their import path inside their source. This has a number of benefits:
    
    1. enables users to define their own custom paths directly in their assets
    2. moves the import path "close" to the asset instead of centralized in the plugin definition, which seems "better" to me.
    3. makes "internal hot shader reloading" way more reasonable (see #3966)
    4. logically opens the door to importing "parts" of a shader by defining "import_path blocks".
    
    ```rust
    #define_import_path bevy_pbr::mesh_struct
    
    struct Mesh {
        model: mat4x4<f32>;
        inverse_transpose_model: mat4x4<f32>;
        // 'flags' is a bit field indicating various options. u32 is 32 bits so we have up to 32 options.
        flags: u32;
    };
    
    let MESH_FLAGS_SHADOW_RECEIVER_BIT: u32 = 1u;

    Proper prehashing (#3963)
    
    For some keys, it is too expensive to hash them on every lookup. Historically in Bevy, we have regrettably done the "wrong" thing in these cases (pre-computing hashes, then re-hashing them) because Rust's built in hashed collections don't give us the tools we need to do otherwise. Doing this is "wrong" because two different values can result in the same hash. Hashed collections generally get around this by falling back to equality checks on hash collisions. You can't do that if the key _is_ the hash. Additionally, re-hashing a hash increase the odds of collision!
    
    #3959 needs pre-hashing to be viable, so I decided to finally properly solve the problem. The solution involves two different changes:
    
    1. A new generalized "pre-hashing" solution in bevy_utils: `Hashed<T>` types, which store a value alongside a pre-computed hash. And `PreHashMap<K, V>` (which uses `Hashed<T>` internally) . `PreHashMap` is just an alias for a normal HashMap that uses `Hashed<T>` as the key and a new `PassHash` implementation as the Hasher.
    2. Replacing the `std::collections` re-exports in `bevy_utils` with equivalent `hashbrown` impls. Avoiding re-hashes requires the `raw_entry_mut` api, which isn't stabilized yet (and may never be ... `entry_ref` has favor now, but also isn't available yet). If std's HashMap ever provides the tools we need, we can move back to that. The latest version of `hashbrown` adds support for the `entity_ref` api, so we can move to that in preparation for an std migration, if thats the direction they seem to be going in. Note that adding hashbrown doesn't increase our dependency count because it was already in our tree.
    
    In addition to providing these core tools, I also ported the "table identity hashing" in `bevy_ecs` to `raw_entry_mut`, which was a particularly egregious case.
    
    The biggest outstanding case is `AssetPathId`, which stores a pre-hash. We need AssetPathId to be cheaply clone-able (and ideally Copy), but `Hashed<AssetPath>` requires ownership of the AssetPath, which makes cloning ids way more expensive. We could consider doing `Hashed<Arc<AssetPath>>`, but cloning an arc is still a non-trivial expensive that needs to be considered. I would like to handle this in a separate PR. And given that we will be re-evaluating the Bevy Assets implementation in the very near future, I'd prefer to hold off until after that conversation is concluded.

    bevy_render: Use RenderDevice to get limits/features and expose AdapterInfo (#3931)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `WgpuOptions` is mutated to be updated with the actual device limits and features, but this information is readily available to both the main and render worlds through the `RenderDevice` which has .limits() and .features() methods
    - Information about the adapter in terms of its name, the backend in use, etc were not being exposed but have clear use cases for being used to take decisions about what rendering code to use. For example, if something works well on AMD GPUs but poorly on Intel GPUs. Or perhaps something works well in Vulkan but poorly in DX12.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Stop mutating `WgpuOptions `and don't insert the updated values into the main and render worlds
    - Return `AdapterInfo` from `initialize_renderer` and insert it into the main and render worlds
    - Use `RenderDevice` limits in the lighting code that was using `WgpuOptions.limits`.
    - Renamed `WgpuOptions` to `WgpuSettings`

    # Objective
    `FocusPolicy` allows tracking `Interaction` of a parent node when a player hovers/clicks at the child node, and I see no reason why it shouldn't exist in these 2 nodes.
    
    Resolves #2488
    
    ## Solution
    Add it!
    
    In the tracking system it's used as `Option`: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e749ee786c3a3ca11718b08f0545aa90e4b5aae6/crates/bevy_ui/src/focus.rs#L71 and then it treats it as `Block` if it's not present: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e749ee786c3a3ca11718b08f0545aa90e4b5aae6/crates/bevy_ui/src/focus.rs#L162 and the default value is https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e749ee786c3a3ca11718b08f0545aa90e4b5aae6/crates/bevy_ui/src/focus.rs#L47-L51 so it should be compatible with all existing UIs that use `..Default::default()`

    bevy_render: Support overriding wgpu features and limits (#3912)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Support overriding wgpu features and limits that were calculated from default values or queried from the adapter/backend.
    - Fixes #3686
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `disabled_features: Option<wgpu::Features>` to `WgpuOptions`
    - Add `constrained_limits: Option<wgpu::Limits>` to `WgpuOptions`
    - After maybe obtaining updated features and limits from the adapter/backend in the case of `WgpuOptionsPriority::Functionality`, enable the `WgpuOptions` `features`, disable the `disabled_features`, and constrain the `limits` by `constrained_limits`.
      - Note that constraining the limits means for `wgpu::Limits` members named `max_.*` we take the minimum of that which was configured/queried for the backend/adapter and the specified constrained limit value. This means the configured/queried value is used if the constrained limit is larger as that is as much as the device/API supports, or the constrained limit value is used if it is smaller as we are imposing an artificial constraint. For members named `min_.*` we take the maximum instead. For example, a minimum stride might be 256 but we set constrained limit value of 1024, then 1024 is the more conservative value. If the constrained limit value were 16, then 256 would be the more conservative.

However, it was also swapping the vertex positions, which resulted in inverted winding order so the front became a back face, and the normal was pointing into the face instead of out of it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This change makes the only difference the UVs being horizontally flipped.

    In [this commit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/commit/a52f755ce8dfffe53329163364908937c780057d), the signature of `run_return` was changed in winit.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This tiny PR does not add support for exit code, but makes compilation successful.

    fix unreachable macro calls for rust 2021 (#3889)
    
    # Objective
    
    - It was decided in Rust 2021 to make macro like `panic` require a string literal to format instead of directly an object
    - `unreachable` was missed during the first pass but it was decided to go for it anyway now: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92137#issuecomment-1019519285
    - this is making Bevy CI fail now: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/runs/5102586734?check_suite_focus=true

    Move the CoreStage::Startup to a seperate StartupSchedule label (#2434)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `CoreStage::Startup` is unique in the `CoreStage` enum, in that it represents a `Schedule` and not a `SystemStage`.
    - This can lead to confusion about how `CoreStage::Startup` and the `StartupStage` enum are related.
    - Beginners sometimes try `.add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::Startup, setup.system())` instead of `.add_startup_system(setup.system())`, which causes a Panic:
    ```

    doc: remove mention of void return type in entry_point docs (#3881)
    
    # Objective
    
    The docs for `{VertexState, FragmentState}::entry_point` stipulate that the entry point function in the shader must return void. This seems to be specific to GLSL; WGSL has no `void` type and its entry point functions return values that describe their output.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Remove the mention of the `void` return type.

    # Objective
    
    - Currently, when getting a diagnostic value, the oldest value is returned. This is not the best for a diagnostic with a large history, as you could get a value from several frames away
    
    ## Solution
    
    - I changed the order in which the history is used to follow ["The “default” usage of this type as a queue is to use push_back to add to the queue, and pop_front to remove from the queue."](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/vec_deque/struct.VecDeque.html)

    allow Entity to be deserialized with serde_json (#3873)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `serde_json` assumes that numbers being deserialized are either u64 or i64.
    - `Entity` serializes and deserializes as a u32.
    - Deserializing an `Entity` with `serde_json` fails with: `Error("invalid type: integer 10947, expected expected Entity"`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Implemented a visitor for u64 that allows an `Entity` to be deserialized in this case.
    - While I was here, also fixed the redundant "expected expected Entity" in the error message
    - Tested the change in a local project which now correctly deserializes `Entity` structs with `serde_json` when it couldn't before

    Add TransformBundle (#3054)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Bevy currently has no simple way to make an "empty" Entity work correctly in a Hierachy.
      - The current Solution is to insert a Tuple instead:
    
    ```rs
    .insert_bundle((Transform::default(), GlobalTransform::default()))
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    * Add a `TransformBundle` that combines the Components:
    
    ```rs
    .insert_bundle(TransformBundle::default())
    ```
    
    * The code is based on #2331, except for missing the more controversial usage of `TransformBundle` as a Sub-bundle in preexisting Bundles.

    Implement AnyOf queries (#2889)
    
    Implements a new Queryable called AnyOf, which will return an item as long as at least one of it's requested Queryables returns something. For example, a `Query<AnyOf<(&A, &B, &C)>>` will return items with type `(Option<&A>, Option<&B>, Option<&C>)`, and will guarantee that for every element at least one of the option s is Some. This is a shorthand for queries like `Query<(Option<&A>, Option<&B>, Option<&C>), Or<(With<A>, With<B>, With&C>)>>`.

    bevy_asset: Add AssetServerSettings watch_for_changes member (#3643)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `asset_server.watch_for_changes().unwrap()` only watches changes for assets loaded **_after_** that call.
    - Technically, the `hot_asset_reloading` example is racey as the watch on the asset path is set up in an async task scheduled from the asset `load()`, but the filesystem watcher is only constructed in a call that comes **_after_** the call to `load()`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    -  It feels safest to allow enabling watching the filesystem for changes on the asset server from the point of its construction. Therefore, adding such an option to `AssetServerSettings` seemed to be the correct solution.
    - Fix `hot_asset_reloading` by inserting the `AssetServerSettings` resource with `watch_for_changes: true` instead of calling `asset_server.watch_for_changes().unwrap()`.
    - Document the shortcomings of `.watch_for_changes()`

    The query for `VisiblePointLights` in `check_light_mesh_visibility` has a `Without<DirectionalLight>` filter. However, because `VisiblePointLights` is no longer an alias for `VisibleEntities`, the query won't conflict with the query for `DirectionalLight`s and thus the filter is unnecessary.

    Added method to restart the current state (#3328)
    
    # Objective
    
    It would be useful to be able to restart a state (such as if an operation fails and needs to be retried from `on_enter`). Currently, it seems the way to restart a state is to transition to a dummy state and then transition back.
    
    ## Solution
    
    The solution is to add a `restart` method on `State<T>` that allows for transitioning to the already-active state.
    
    ## Context
    
    Based on [this](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/742884593551802431/920335041756815441) question from the Discord.

    derive clone for Input (#3569)
    
    # Objective
    
    - As part of exploring input event suppression in bevy_egui here: https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui/pull/50/commits/53c1773583f2dfc2a8f8bc2aa93de1c9c5fd05ec
    - I found that the only way to suppress events properly, is to allow to clone the relevant Input<Whatever>, and update with events manually from within the system. This cloned Input then is discarded, the Events<*> structs are cleared, and bevy_input's normal update of Input proceeds, without the events that have been suppressed.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This enables Input to be cloned, allowing it to be manually updated with events.

    > - The default title should be changed to app so we don't leak the "bevy context" by default. app is generic enough that most people building real games will probably want to change it, but also generic enough that if someone doesn't manually set it, users won't bat an eye. I prefer this to binary names because they won't be consistent on all platforms / setups. A user (or developer) renaming a binary would implicitly rename the window title, which feels odd to me.
    > - No debug info in the title by default. An opt in plugin for that would be nice though.
    
    closes #3404 ?

    improve error message for attempting to add systems using add_system_to_stage (#3287)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #3250
    
    ## Solution
    
    Since this panic occurs in bevy_ecs, and StartupStage is part of
    bevy_app, we really only have access to the Debug string of the
    `stage_label` parameter.  This led me to the hacky solution of
    comparing the debug output of the label the user provides with the known
    variants of StartupStage.
    
    An alternative would be to do this error handling further up in
    bevy_app, where we can access StartupStage's typeid, but I don't think
    it is worth having a panic in 2 places (_ecs, and _app).

    Add Transform::rotate_around method (#3107)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Missing obvious way to rotate a transform around a point. This is popularly used for rotation of an object in world space ("orbiting" a point), or for local rotation of an object around a pivot point on that object.
    - Present in other (not to be named) game engines
    - Was question from user on Discord today (thread "object rotation")
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added Transform::rotate_around method where point is specified in reference frame of the parent (if any) or in world space.

    Simplify sending empty events (#2935)
    
    # Objective
    
    When using empty events, it can feel redundant to have to specify the type of the event when sending it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a new `fire()` function that sends the default value of the event. This requires that the event derives Default.

    Make ECS benchmark more representative (#2941)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The addition was being optimised out in the `for_each` loop, but not the `for` loop
    - Previously this meant that the `for_each` loop looked 3 times as fast - it's actually only 2 times as fast
    - Effectively, the addition take one unit of time, the for_each takes one unit of time, and the for loop version takes two units of time.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `black_box` the count in each loop
    
    Note that this does not fix `for_each` being faster than `for`, unfortunately.

    Run tests (including doc tests) in `cargo run -p ci` command (#3849)

    - Using the `cargo run -p ci` command locally is unreliable, as it does not run tests.
    - This is particularly unreliable for doc tests, as they are not run as part of `cargo test`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - add more steps to the appropriate Rust file.
    
    ## Known Problems
    
    This duplicates work done to run tests when run on Github. @mockersf, suggestions on if we care / how we can mitigate it?

    impl Command for <impl FnOnce(&mut World)> (#2996)
    
    This is my first contribution to this exciting project! Thanks so much for your wonderful work. If there is anything that I can improve about this PR, please let me know :)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #2899
    - If a simple one-off command is needed to be added within a System, this simplifies that process so that we can simply do `commands.add(|world: &mut World| { /* code here */ })` instead of defining a custom type implementing `Command`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This is achieved by `impl Command for F where F: FnOnce(&mut World) + Send + Sync + 'static` as just calling the function.
    
    I am not sure if the bounds can be further relaxed but needed the whole `Send`, `Sync`, and `'static` to get it to compile.

    SystemParam Derive fixes (#2838)
    
    # Objective
    
    A user on Discord couldn't derive SystemParam for this Struct:
    
    ```rs
    #[derive(SystemParam)]
    pub struct SpatialQuery<'w, 's, Q: WorldQuery + Send + Sync + 'static, F: WorldQuery + Send + Sync + 'static = ()>
    where
        F::Fetch: FilterFetch,
    {
        query: Query<'w, 's, (C, &'static Transform), F>,
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    1. The `where`-clause is now also copied to the `SystemParamFetch` impl Block.
    2. The `SystemParamState` impl Block no longer gets any defaults for generics

    docs: Fix private doc links and enable CI test (#3743)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #3566
    
    ## Solution
    
    - [x] Fix broken links in private docs.
    - [x] Add the `--document-private-items` flag to the CI.
    
    ## Note
    
    The following was said by @killercup in #3566:
    
    > I don't have time to confirm this but I assume that linking to private items throws an error/warning when just running cargo doc, and --document-private-item might actually hide that warning. So to test this, you'd have to run it twice.
    
    I tested this and this is thankfully not the case. If you are linking to a private item you will get a warning no matter if you run `cargo doc` or `cargo doc --document-private-items`.
    
    ### Example
    
    I added `struct Test;` to `bevy_core/src/name.rs` and linked to it inside of a doc comment using ``[`Test`]``. After that I ran `cargo doc -p bevy_core --document-private-items` using `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"` and got the following output (note the last sentence):
    
    ```rust
    error: public documentation for `Name` links to private item `Test`
      --> crates/bevy_core/src/name.rs:11:82
       |
    11 | /// Component used to identify an entity. Stores a hash for faster comparisons [`Test`]
       |                                                                                  ^^^^ this item is private
       |
       = note: `-D rustdoc::private-intra-doc-links` implied by `-D warnings`
       = note: this link resolves only because you passed `--document-private-items`, but will break without
    ```

    ## Objective
    There is no bevy example that shows how to transform a sprite. At least as its singular purpose. This creates an example of how to use transform.translate to move a sprite up and down. The last pull request had issues that I couldn't fix so I created a new one
    
    ### Solution
    I created move_sprite example.

    Increment last event count on next instead of iter (#2382)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, simply calling `iter` on an event reader will mark all of it's events as read, even if the returned iterator is never used
    
    ## Solution
    
    With this, the cursor will simply move to the last unread, but available event when iter is called, and incremented by one per `next` call.

    Add the Inside version to the Collision enum (#2489)
    
    # Objective
    I think the 'collide' function inside the 'bevy/crates/bevy_sprite/src/collide_aabb.rs' file should return 'Some' if the two rectangles are fully overlapping or one is inside the other. This can happen on low-end machines when a lot of time passes between two frames because of a stutter, so a bullet for example gets inside its target. I can also think of situations where this is a valid use case even without stutters.
    
    ## Solution
    I added an 'Inside' version to the Collision enum declared in the file. And I use it, when the two rectangles are overlapping, but we can't say from which direction it happened. I gave a 'penetration depth' of minus Infinity to these cases, so that this variant only appears, when the two rectangles overlap from each side fully. I am not sure if this is the right thing to do.

    - While it is not safe to enable mappable primary buffers for all GPUs, it should be preferred for integrated GPUs where an integrated GPU is one that is sharing system memory.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Auto-disable mappable primary buffers only for discrete GPUs. If the GPU is integrated and mappable primary buffers are supported, use them.

    While trying to learn how to use custom shaders, I had difficulty figuring out how to use a vertex shader. My confusion was mostly because all the other shader examples used a custom pipeline, but I didn't want a custom pipeline. After digging around I realised that I simply needed to add a function to the `impl Material` block. I also searched what was the default shader used, because it wasn't obvious to me where to find it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added a few comments explaining what is going on in the example and a link to the default shader.

    Simple 2d rotation example (#3065)
    
    # Objective
    
    Some new bevy users are unfamiliar with quaternions and have trouble working with rotations in 2D.
    
    There has been an [issue](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs/issues/226) raised with glam to add helpers to better support these users, however for now I feel could be better to provide examples of how to do this in Bevy as a starting point for new users.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I've added a 2d_rotation example which demonstrates 3 different rotation examples to try help get people started:
    
    - Rotating and translating a player ship based on keyboard input
    - An enemy ship type that rotates to face the player ship immediately
    - An enemy ship type that rotates to face the player at a fixed angular velocity
    
    I also have a standalone version of this example here https://github.com/bitshifter/bevy-2d-rotation-example but I think it would be more discoverable if it's included with Bevy.

    Update docstrings for `text_system` and `text2d_system` (#3732)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #3562
    
    ## Solution
    
    - The outdated reference to `TextGlyphs` has been removed, and replaced with a more accurate docstring.
    
    ## What was `TextGlyphs`?
    This is the real question of this Issue and PR. This is particulary interesting because not only is `TextGlyphs` not a type in bevy, but it _never was_. Indeed, this type never existed on main. Where did it come from?
    
    `TextGlyphs` was originally a tuple struct wrapping a `Vec<PositionedGlyph>`. It was first introduced back in commit https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/765/commits/ec390aec4ebe7192e3470dddf1e8af36f10453e6 in #765. At the time, position information was being stored on the text entities directly. However, after design review, [it was decided](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/765#issuecomment-725047186) to instead store the glyphs in a `HashMap` owned by the `TextPipeline`. When this was done, the original type was not only removed, but abstracted behind a few layers of the `TextPipeline` API. Obviously, the original docstring wasn't updated accordingly.
    
    Later, as part of #1122, the incorrect docstring was swept up when copy/pasting `text_system` for `text2d`. (Although I don't blame @CleanCut for this; it took me like 3 hours to track all this down to find the original context.)

    bevy_render: Provide a way to opt-out of the built-in frustum culling (#3711)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow opting-out of the built-in frustum culling for cases where its behaviour would be incorrect
    - Make use of the this in the shader_instancing example that uses a custom instancing method. The built-in frustum culling breaks the custom instancing in the shader_instancing example if the camera is moved to:
    
    ```rust
        commands.spawn_bundle(PerspectiveCameraBundle {
            transform: Transform::from_xyz(12.0, 0.0, 15.0)
                .looking_at(Vec3::new(12.0, 0.0, 0.0), Vec3::Y),
            ..Default::default()
        });
    ```
    
    ...such that the Aabb of the cube Mesh that is at the origin goes completely out of view. This incorrectly (for the purpose of the custom instancing) culls the `Mesh` and so culls all instances even though some may be visible.
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `NoFrustumCulling` marker component
    - Do not compute and add an `Aabb` to `Mesh` entities without an `Aabb` if they have a `NoFrustumCulling` marker component
    - Do not apply frustum culling to entities with the `NoFrustumCulling` marker component

    - When using `WgpuOptionsPriority::Functionality`, which is the default, wgpu::Features::MAPPABLE_PRIMARY_BUFFERS would be automatically enabled. This feature can and does have a significant negative impact on performance for discrete GPUs where resizable bar is not supported, which is a common case. As such, this feature should not be automatically enabled.

    Added API guidelines to CONTRIBUTING.md (#3646)
    
    Closes #3497.
    
    I added the rust API guidelines (https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html) to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    
    ## Note
    As noted in #3497 we should note any areas where we deliberately disagree as they arise. If we start adding these areas it might be a good idea to remove the mention of the `API guidelines` in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file and move it to the `engine_style_guide.md`. That way we still have the connection between the `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `API guidelines`, but we have more "space" to work with and can go into more detail about what we agree and disagree on.
    
    For now I would leave it this way, because it's one less click to get to the guidelines.

    Don't panic in macro shape validation (#3647)
    
    # Objective
    Emitting compile errors produces cleaner messages than panicking in a proc-macro.
    
    ## Solution
    - Replace match-with-panic code with call to new `bevy_macro_utils::get_named_struct_fields` function
    - Replace one use of match-with-panic for enums with inline match
    
    _Aside:_ I'm also the maintainer of [`darling`](https://docs.rs/darling), a crate which provides a serde-like API for parsing macro inputs. I avoided using it here because it seemed like overkill, but if there are plans to add lots more attributes/macros then that might be a good way of offloading macro error handling.

    Documentation: simplify NixOS dependencies (#3527)
    
    # Objective
    
    The description of NixOS dependencies is extremely long and spends entire paragraphs just for simple line changes.
    With this PR it should be much simpler.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Linking Vulkan in `build.rs` is less effective than adding it in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so I removed the former (related to #1992);
    - I put a simple comment explaining the line in the list of dependencies, instead of making entire paragraphs;
    - Clang is not in an absolute path in `.cargo/config_fast_builds` anymore, so that there is no need to specify it in `docs/linux_dependencies.md` (didn't test if this breaks other distros, though I doubt it. Also, maybe it could also be done on Darwin for consistency?);
    - Also added optional wayland dependencies.
    
    A few notes:
    - The x11 libraries will be linked only during the compilation phase. This means that if you use the `x11` feature without these libraries in the environment (for example because you forget to enter the nix shell before compiling), the program will still compile successfully but won't run. You'll have to `cargo clean` and recompile with the x11 libraries in the environment. I don't know if this is important enough to be added to the documentation, but it's not specified anywhere, though I don't think it's specific to NixOS;
    - The wayland dependencies need to be put in LD_LIBRARY_PATH only in certain conditions (IIRC, only if using the `dynamic` feature) and the text doesn't specify it. Because putting them there doesn't increase the number of dependencies (they are already in buildInputs) or alter the performance, I doubt anyone will care;
    - Should I comment out what isn't needed by default?
    - ~I removed `cargo` from buildInputs. Ignoring the fact that it should be in nativeBuildInputs, having it in `shell.nix` allows to use stable Rust in case it's not in the system environment, but maybe the user wanted to use the version that was already in the system environment and will be caught by surprise. In my opinion, if someone is looking at a Bevy's documentation on NixOS, that user will either have Rust already in the system environment (eg. via rustup) or is capable to add the toolchain they want on shell.nix by themselves. This isn't exactly the place to explain how this works.~ ~EDIT: I replaced `cargo` with Rust from the [Oxalica overlay](https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay) in order to have the latest nightly.~ EDIT: Removed `cargo` from dependencies. See comments for details.

    Enable the `doc_markdown` clippy lint (#3457)
    
    # Objective
    
    CI should check for missing backticks in doc comments.
    
    Fixes #3435
    
    ## Solution
    
    `clippy` has a lint for this: `doc_markdown`. This enables that lint in the CI script.
    
    Of course, enabling this lint in CI causes a bunch of lint errors, so I've gone through and fixed all of them. This was a huge edit that touched a ton of files, so I split the PR up by crate.
    
    When all of the following are merged, the CI should pass and this can be merged.

    Add 2d meshes and materials (#3460)
    
    # Objective
    
    The current 2d rendering is specialized to render sprites, we need a generic way to render 2d items, using meshes and materials like we have for 3d.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I cloned a good part of `bevy_pbr` into `bevy_sprite/src/mesh2d`, removed lighting and pbr itself, adapted it to 2d rendering, added a `ColorMaterial`, and modified the sprite rendering to break batches around 2d meshes.
    
    ~~The PR is a bit crude; I tried to change as little as I could in both the parts copied from 3d and the current sprite rendering to make reviewing easier. In the future, I expect we could make the sprite rendering a normal 2d material, cleanly integrated with the rest.~~ _edit: see <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3460#issuecomment-1003605194>_
    
    ## Remaining work
    
    - ~~don't require mesh normals~~ _out of scope_
    - ~~add an example~~ _done_
    - support 2d meshes & materials in the UI?
    - bikeshed names (I didn't think hard about naming, please check if it's fine)
    
    ## Remaining questions
    
    - ~~should we add a depth buffer to 2d now that there are 2d meshes?~~ _let's revisit that when we have an opaque render phase_
    - ~~should we add MSAA support to the sprites, or remove it from the 2d meshes?~~ _I added MSAA to sprites since it's really needed for 2d meshes_
    - ~~how to customize vertex attributes?~~ _#3120_

    bevy_pbr: Use a special first depth slice for clustered forward (#3545)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Using plain exponential depth slicing for perspective projection cameras results in unnecessarily many slices very close together close to the camera. If the camera is then moved close to a collection of point lights, they will likely exhaust the available uniform buffer space for the lists of which lights affect which clusters.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - A simple solution to this is to use a different near plane value for the depth slicing and set it to where the first slice's far plane should be. The default value is 5 and works well. This results in the configured number of depth slices, maintains the exponential slicing beyond the initial slice, and no slices are too small such that they cause problems that are sensitive to the view position.

    Add instruction to enable ALSA api routing on Arch / Manjaro systems (#3455)
    
    # Objective
    
    Every few months a person using Arch asks for help with the following error on discord:
    ```
    ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:1032:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) unable to open slave
    ```
    This error is caused by their sound server not being configured for ALSA. The fix is to install `pipewire-alsa` or `pulseaudio-alsa` depending on the sound server they use.
    
    Examples:
    - https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/749690364792668301/924380204237987861

    ## Solution
    
    Add the instruction to install either `pipewire-alsa` or `pulseaudio-alsa` to [linux_dependencies.md](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md#arch--manjaro)

    A lot of people don't run into this issue because `pipewire-alsa` / `pulseaudio-alsa` is a dependency for gnome and cinnamon.

    Fix `doc_markdown` lints in `bevy_ui` (#3484)
    
    #3457 adds the `doc_markdown` clippy lint, which checks doc comments to make sure code identifiers are escaped with backticks. This causes a lot of lint errors, so this is one of a number of PR's that will fix those lint errors one crate at a time.
    
    This PR fixes lints in the `bevy_ui` crate.

    Removal detection cleanup (#3010)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #1920.
    - Users often want to know how to get the values of removed components (#1655).
    - Stand-alone `bevy_ecs` behavior is very unintuitive, as `World::clear_trackers()` must be manually called.
    - Fixes #2999 by extending the existing test (thanks @hymm for pointing me to it) to be clearer and check for component removal as well.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Better docs!
    - Better tests!

    add some more pipelined-rendering shader examples (#3041)
    
    based on #3031
    
    Adds some examples showing of how to use the new pipelined rendering for custom shaders.
    
    - a minimal shader example which doesn't use render assets
    - the same but using glsl
    - an example showing how to render instanced data
    - a shader which uses the seconds since startup to animate some textures

    Configurable wgpu features/limits priority (#3452)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow the user to specify the priority when configuring wgpu features/limits and by default use the maximum capabilities of the chosen adapter.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `WgpuOptionsPriority` enum with `Compatibility`, `Functionality` and `WebGL2` options.
    - Add a `priority: WgpuOptionsPriority` member to `WgpuOptions`.
    - When initialising the renderer, if `WgpuOptions::priority == WgpuOptionsPriority::Functionality`, query the adapter for the available features and limits, use them when creating a device, and update `WgpuOptions` with those values. If `Compatibility` use the behaviour as before this PR. If `WebGL2` then use the WebGL2 downlevel limits as used when when building for wasm, for convenience of testing WebGL2 limits without having to build for wasm.
    - Add an environment variable `WGPU_OPTIONS_PRIO` that takes `compatibility`, `functionality`, `webgl2`.
    - Default to `WgpuOptionsPriority::Functionality`.
    - Insert updated `WgpuOptions` into render app world as well. This is useful for applying the limits when rendering, such as limiting the directional light shadow map texture to 2048x2048 when using WebGL2 downlevel limits but not on wasm.
    - Reduced `draw_state` logs from `debug` to `trace` and added `debug` level logs for the wgpu features and limits. Use `RUST_LOG=bevy_render=debug` to see the output.

    Use fully-qualified type names in proc macro. (#3544)
    
    Modifies the code emitted by `derive_label` to use fully-qualified type
    names (e.g. `std::boxed::Box` instead of `Box`).
    
    # Objective
    
    - Using unqualified types here causes errors when the proc macro is used in contexts that locally define types with conflicting names (e.g. a local definition of `Box`).
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Fully qualify standard types emitted by the proc macro code.

    Update nalgebra requirement from 0.29.0 to 0.30.0 (#3540)
    
    Updates the requirements on [nalgebra](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra) to permit the latest version.
    <details>
    <summary>Changelog</summary>
    <p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md">nalgebra's changelog</a>.</em></p>
    <blockquote>
    <h2>[0.30.0] (02 Jan. 2022)</h2>
    <h3>Breaking changes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>The <code>Dim</code> trait is now marked as unsafe.</li>
    <li>The <code>Matrix::pow</code> and <code>Matrix::pow_mut</code> methods only allow positive integer exponents now. To compute negative
    exponents, the user is free to invert the matrix before calling <code>pow</code> with the exponent’s absolute value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Modified</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Use more concise debug impls for matrices and geometric transformation types.</li>
    <li>The singular values computed by the SVD are now sorted in increasing order by default. Use <code>SVD::new_unordered</code>
    instead to reproduce the older behavior without the sorting overhead.</li>
    <li>The <code>UnitDualQuaternion::sclerp</code> method will no longer panic when given two equal rotations.</li>
    <li>The <code>Matrix::select_rows</code> and <code>Matrix::select_columns</code> methods no longer require the matrix components to implement
    the trait <code>Zero</code>.</li>
    <li>The <code>Matrix::pow</code> and <code>Matrix::pow_mut</code> methods will now also work with integer matrices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Added</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Added the conversion trait <code>From&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and method <code>from_vec_storage</code> for <code>RowDVector</code>.</li>
    <li>Added implementation of <code>From</code> and <code>Into</code> for converting between <code>nalgebra</code> types and types from
    <code>glam 0.18</code>. These can be enabled by enabling the <code>convert-glam018</code> cargo features.</li>
    <li>Added the methods <code>Matrix::product</code>, <code>::row_product</code>, <code>::row_product_tr</code>, and <code>::column_product</code> to compute the
    product of the components, rows, or columns, of a single matrix or vector.</li>
    <li>The <code>Default</code> trait is now implemented for most geometric types: <code>Point</code>, <code>Isometry</code>, <code>Rotation</code>, <code>Similarity</code>,
    <code>Transform</code>, <code>UnitComplex</code>, and <code>UnitQuaternion</code>.</li>
    <li>Added the <code>Scale</code> geometric type for representing non-uniform scaling.</li>
    <li>Added <code>Cholesky::new_with_substitute</code> that will replace diagonal elements by a given constant whenever <code>Cholesky</code>
    meets a non-definite-positiveness.</li>
    <li>Re-added the conversion from a vector/matrix slice to a static array.</li>
    <li>Added the <code>cuda</code> feature that enables the support of <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA">rust-cuda</a> for using
    <code>nalgebra</code> features with CUDA kernels written in Rust.</li>
    <li>Added special-cases implementations for the 2x2 and 3x3 SVDs for better accuracy and performances.</li>
    <li>Added the methods <code>Matrix::polar</code>, <code>Matrix::try_polar</code>, and <code>SVD::to_polar</code> to compute the polar decomposition of
    a matrix, based on its SVD.</li>
    <li><code>nalgebra-sparse</code>: provide constructors for unsorted but otherwise valid data using the CSR format.</li>
    <li><code>nalgebra-sparse</code>: added reading MatrixMarked data files to a sparse <code>CooMatrix</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fixed</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixed a potential unsoundness with <code>matrix.get(i)</code> and <code>matrix.get_mut(i)</code> where <code>i</code>  is an <code>usize</code>, and <code>matrix</code>
    is a matrix slice with non-default strides.</li>
    <li>Fixed potential unsoundness with <code>vector.perp</code> where <code>vector</code> isn’t actually a 2D vector as expected.</li>
    <li>Fixed linkage issue with <code>nalgebra-lapack</code>: the user of <code>nalgebra-lapack</code> no longer have to add
    <code>extern crate lapack-src</code> to their <code>main.rs</code>.</li>
    <li>Fixed the <code>no-std</code> build of <code>nalgebra-glm</code>.</li>
    <li>Fix the <code>pow</code> and <code>pow_mut</code> functions (the result was incorrect for some exponent values).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>[0.29.0]</h2>
    <h3>Breaking changes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>We updated to the version 0.6 of <code>simba</code>. This means that the trait bounds <code>T: na::RealField</code>, <code>na::ComplexField</code>,
    <code>na::SimdRealField</code>, <code>na:SimdComplexField</code> no imply that <code>T: Copy</code> (they only imply that <code>T: Clone</code>). This may affect</li>

    bevy_gltf: Add support for loading lights (#3506)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add support for loading lights from glTF 2.0 files
    
    ## Solution
    
    - This adds support for the KHR_punctual_lights extension which supports point, directional, and spot lights, though we don't yet support spot lights.
    - Inserting light bundles when creating scenes required registering some more light bundle component types.

    This PR is part of the issue #3492.
    
    # Objective
    
     - Clean up dead code in `bevy_core`.
     - Add and update the `bevy_core` documentation to achieve a 100% documentation coverage.
     - Add the #![warn(missing_docs)] lint to keep the documentation coverage for the future.
    
    # Solution
    
     - Remove unused `Bytes`, `FromBytes`, `Labels`, and `EntityLabels` types and associated systems.
     - Made several types private that really only have use as internal types, mostly pertaining to fixed timestep execution.
     - Add and update the bevy_core documentation.
     - Add the #![warn(missing_docs)] lint.
    
    # Open Questions
    
    Should more of the internal states of `FixedTimestep` be public? Seems mostly to be an implementation detail unless someone really needs that fixed timestep state.

    Remove Lutris from NixOS dependency section (#2945)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Using the instructions given for NixOS results in an unnecessarily long time to evaluate the shell expression due to unnecessary dependencies pulled in by `lutris`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Removed `lutris` dependency.
    
    Lutris is a GUI tool for running games on wine, I'm assuming it was pulled in by accident as it's definitely not necessary for running bevy. A hello world example, at the least, works fine without it.

    Enable Msaa for webgl by default (#3489)
    
    # Objective
    
    - `Msaa` was disabled in webgl due to a bug in wgpu
    - Bug has been fixed (https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/2307) and backported (https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/2327), and updates for [`wgpu-core`](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu-core/0.12.1) and [`wgpu-hal`](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu-hal/0.12.1) have been released
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove custom config for `Msaa` in webgl
    - I also changed two options that were using the arch instead of the `webgl` feature. it shouldn't change much for webgl, but could help if someone wants to target wasm but not webgl2

    Add FromReflect trait to convert dynamic types to concrete types (#1395)
    
    Dynamic types (`DynamicStruct`, `DynamicTupleStruct`, `DynamicTuple`, `DynamicList` and `DynamicMap`) are used when deserializing scenes, but currently they can only be applied to existing concrete types. This leads to issues when trying to spawn non trivial deserialized scene.
    For components, the issue is avoided by requiring that reflected components implement ~~`FromResources`~~ `FromWorld` (or `Default`). When spawning, a new concrete type is created that way, and the dynamic type is applied to it. Unfortunately, some components don't have any valid implementation of these traits.
    In addition, any `Vec` or `HashMap` inside a component will panic when a dynamic type is pushed into it (for instance, `Text` panics when adding a text section).
    
    To solve this issue, this PR adds the `FromReflect` trait that creates a concrete type from a dynamic type that represent it, derives the trait alongside the `Reflect` trait, drops the ~~`FromResources`~~ `FromWorld` requirement on reflected components, ~~and enables reflection for UI and Text bundles~~. It also adds the requirement that fields ignored with `#[reflect(ignore)]` implement `Default`, since we need to initialize them somehow.

    Materials and MaterialPlugin (#3428)
    
    This adds "high level" `Material` and `SpecializedMaterial` traits, which can be used with a `MaterialPlugin<T: SpecializedMaterial>`. `MaterialPlugin` automatically registers the appropriate resources, draw functions, and queue systems. The `Material` trait is simpler, and should cover most use cases. `SpecializedMaterial` is like `Material`, but it also requires defining a "specialization key" (see #3031). `Material` has a trivial blanket impl of `SpecializedMaterial`, which allows us to use the same types + functions for both.
    
    This makes defining custom 3d materials much simpler (see the `shader_material` example diff) and ensures consistent behavior across all 3d materials (both built in and custom). I ported the built in `StandardMaterial` to `MaterialPlugin`. There is also a new `MaterialMeshBundle<T: SpecializedMaterial>`, which `PbrBundle` aliases to.

    Add Visibility component to UI (#3426)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes #3422
    
    ## Solution
    
    Adds the existing `Visibility` component to UI bundles and checks for it in the extract phase of the render app.
    
    The `ComputedVisibility` component was not added. I don't think the UI camera needs frustum culling, but having `RenderLayers` work may be desirable. However I think we would need to change `check_visibility()` to differentiate between 2d, 3d and UI entities.

    fix parenting of scenes (#2410)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fix #2406
    
    Scene parenting was not done completely, leaving the hierarchy maintenance to the standard system. As scene spawning happens in stage `PreUpdate` and hierarchy maintenance in stage `PostUpdate`, this left the scene in an invalid state parent wise for part of a frame
    
    ## Solution
    
    Also add/update the `Children` component when spawning the scene.
    
    I kept the `Children` component as a `SmallVec`, it could be moved to an `HashSet` to guarantee uniqueness

    Prepare crevice for vendored release (#3394)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Our crevice is still called "crevice", which we can't use for a release
    - Users would need to use our "crevice" directly to be able to use the derive macro
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Rename crevice to bevy_crevice, and crevice-derive to bevy-crevice-derive
    - Re-export it from bevy_render, and use it from bevy_render everywhere
    - Fix derive macro to work either from bevy_render, from bevy_crevice, or from bevy
    
    ## Remaining
    
    - It is currently re-exported as `bevy::render::bevy_crevice`, is it the path we want?
    - After a brief suggestion to Cart, I changed the version to follow Bevy version instead of crevice, do we want that?
    - Crevice README.md need to be updated
    - in the `Cargo.toml`, there are a few things to change. How do we want to change them? How do we keep attributions to original Crevice?
    ```
    authors = ["Lucien Greathouse <me@lpghatguy.com>"]
    documentation = "https://docs.rs/crevice"
    homepage = "https://github.com/LPGhatguy/crevice"
    repository = "https://github.com/LPGhatguy/crevice"

    ### Problem
    - shader processing errors are not displayed
    - during hot reloading when encountering a shader with errors, the whole app crashes
    
    ### Solution
    - log `error!`s for shader processing errors
    - when `cfg(debug_assertions)` is enabled (i.e. you're running in `debug` mode), parse shaders before passing them to wgpu. This lets us handle errors early.

    # Objective
    
    - 3d examples fail to run in webgl2 because of unsupported texture formats or texture too large
    
    ## Solution

    Very inspired by https://github.com/superdump/bevy/commit/6813b2edc5eb5833b11bb7b4f01a3c662d1953e2, and need #3290 to work.
    
    I named the feature `webgl2`, but it's only needed if one want to use PBR in webgl2. Examples using only 2D already work.

    Implement the `Overflow::Hidden` style property for UI (#3296)
    
    # Objective
    
    This PR implements the `overflow` style property in `bevy_ui`. When set to `Overflow::Hidden`, the children of that node are clipped so that overflowing parts are not rendered. This is an important building block for UI widgets.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Clipping is done on the CPU so that it does not break batching.
    
    The clip regions update was implemented as a separate system for clarity, but it could be merged with the other UI systems to avoid doing an additional tree traversal. (I don't think it's important until we fix the layout performance issues though).
    
    A scrolling list was added to the `ui_pipelined` example to showcase `Overflow::Hidden`. For the sake of simplicity, it can only be scrolled with a mouse.

    Improved bevymark: no bouncing offscreen and spawn waves from CLI (#3364)
    
    # Objective
    
    - In bevymark, bevies were very bouncy and could go off screen after a while, skewing the FPS
    
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8672791/146540848-282fa11b-d058-4da9-8e95-688ae67d9406.mp4
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Make bevies bounce also on top of the screen
    - I also changed how the examples read args from CLI to be able to spawn waves: `cargo run --example bevymark --release -- 5 100` (first is number of bevy per wave, second is number of wave, with one wave every 0.2 seconds). This makes it easier to reproduce some exact situations

    Add an example to draw a rectangle (#2957)
    
    # Objective
    
    Every time I come back to Bevy I face the same issue: how do I draw a rectangle again? How did that work? So I go to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/examples in the hope of finding literally the simplest possible example that draws something on the screen without any dependency such as an image. I don't want to have to add some image first, I just quickly want to get something on the screen with `main.rs` alone so that I can continue building on from that point on. Such an example is particularly helpful for a quick start for smaller projects that don't even need any assets such as images (this is my case currently).
    
    Currently every single example of https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/examples#2d-rendering (which is the first section after hello world that beginners will look for for very minimalistic and quick examples) depends on at least an asset or is too complex. This PR solves this.
    It also serves as a great comparison for a beginner to realize what Bevy is really like and how different it is from what they may expect Bevy to be. For example for someone coming from [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), they will have something like this in their head when they think of drawing a rectangle:
    ```lua
    function love.draw()
        love.graphics.setColor(0.25, 0.25, 0.75);
        love.graphics.rectangle("fill", 0, 0, 50, 50);
    end
    ```
    This, of course, differs quite a lot from what you do in Bevy. I imagine there will be people that just want to see something as simple as this in comparison to have a better understanding for the amount of differences.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add a dead simple example drawing a blue 50x50 rectangle in the center with no more and no less than needed.

    # Objective
    
    Have the bird spawning/collision systems in bevymark use the proper window size, instead of the size set in WindowDescriptor which isn't updated when the window is resized.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use the Windows resource to grab the width/height from the primary window. This is consistent with the other examples.

    The reason for adding this is to cull fragments that are outside of the given rect. For my purposes this is extremely useful for UI.

    Schedule gilrs system before input systems (#2989)
    
    # Objective
    
    Previously, the gilrs system had no explicit relationship to the input
    systems. This could potentially cause it to be scheduled after the
    input systems, leading to a one-frame lag in gamepad inputs.
    
    This was a regression introduced in #1606 which removed the `PreEvent` stage
    
    ## Solution
    
    This adds an explicit `before` relationship to the gilrs plugin,
    ensuring that raw gamepad events will be processed on the same frame
    that they are generated.

    bevy_pbr2: Fix clustering for orthographic projections (#3316)
    
    # Objective
    
    PBR lighting was broken in the new renderer when using orthographic projections due to the way the depth slicing works for the clusters. Fix it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - The default orthographic projection near plane is 0.0. The perspective projection depth slicing does a division by the near plane which gives a floating point NaN and the clustering all breaks down.
    - Orthographic projections have a linear depth mapping, so it made intuitive sense to me to do depth slicing with a linear mapping too. The alternative I saw was to try to handle the near plane being at 0.0 and using the exponential depth slicing, but that felt like a hack that didn't make sense.
    - As such, I have added code that detects whether the projection is orthographic based on `projection[3][3] == 1.0` and then implemented the orthographic mapping case throughout (when computing cluster AABBs, and when mapping a view space position (or light) to a cluster id in both the rust and shader code).

    Replace old renderer with new renderer (#3312)
    
    This makes the [New Bevy Renderer](#2535) the default (and only) renderer. The new renderer isn't _quite_ ready for the final release yet, but I want as many people as possible to start testing it so we can identify bugs and address feedback prior to release.
    
    The examples are all ported over and operational with a few exceptions:
    
    * I removed a good portion of the examples in the `shader` folder. We still have some work to do in order to make these examples possible / ergonomic / worthwhile: #3120 and "high level shader material plugins" are the big ones. This is a temporary measure.
    * Temporarily removed the multiple_windows example: doing this properly in the new renderer will require the upcoming "render targets" changes. Same goes for the render_to_texture example.
    * Removed z_sort_debug: entity visibility sort info is no longer available in app logic. we could do this on the "render app" side, but i dont consider it a priority.

    Run a clear pass on Windows without any Views (#3304)
    
    Fixes #3043
    
    `surface_texture.present()` will cause panics if no work is done on a given frame. "Views" are how we queue up work. Without any cameras, no work is produced. This adds a "clear pass" for windows without views, which ensures we clear windows (thus doing work) every frame.
    
    This is a "quick fix". It can be made much cleaner once we make "render targets" a concept and move some responsibilities around. Then we just clear the "render target" once instead of clearing "views". I _might_ have time to tackle that work prior to 0.6, but I doubt it. If "render targets" don't make it in to 0.6, they will be one of the first things I tackle after release.

    Port bevy_ui to pipelined-rendering (see #2535 )
    
    ## Solution
    
    I did some changes during the port:
    - [X] separate color from the texture asset (as suggested [here](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/743663924229963868/874353914525413406))
    - [X] ~give the vertex shader a per-instance buffer instead of per-vertex buffer~ (incompatible with batching)
    
    Remaining features to implement to reach parity with the old renderer:
    - [x] textures
    - [X] TextBundle
    
    I'd also like to add these features, but they need some design discussion:
    - [x] batching
    - [ ] separate opaque and transparent phases
    - [ ] multiple windows
    - [ ] texture atlases
    - [ ] (maybe) clipping

    Allow `String` and `&String` as `Id` for `AssetServer.get_handle(id)` (#3280)
    
    # Objective
    
    Make it easier to build and use an asset path with `format!()`. This can be useful for accessing assets in a loop.
    
    Enabled by this PR:
    ```rust
    let monkey_handle = asset_server.get_handle(&format!("models/monkey/Monkey.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0"));
    let monkey_handle = asset_server.get_handle(format!("models/monkey/Monkey.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0"));
    ```
    
    Before this PR:
    ```rust
    let monkey_handle = asset_server.get_handle(format!("models/monkey/Monkey.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0").as_str());
    ```
    
    It's just a tiny improvement in ergonomics, but i ran into it and was wondering why the function does not accept a `String` and Bevy is all about simplicity/ergonomics, right? 😄😉
    
    ## Solution
    
    Implement `Into<HandleId>` for `String` and `&String`.

    Add a separate ClearPass (#3209)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Rendering before MainPass should be possible, so clearing needs to happen in an earlier pass.
    - Fixes #3190.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - I added a "Clear" SubGraph, a "ClearPassNode" Node, that clears the color and depth attachments of all views and a "ClearNodeDriver" Node, that schedules the "ClearPassNode" before MainPass.
    - Make sure that the 2d and 3d draw passes do not clear their attachments anymore.
    
    ### Notes
    
    - It works in the way, that with the current pipeline examples nothing should have changed in their behaviour
    - I would like to add an example that adds a pass inbetween ClearPass and MainPass, but I do not understand enough about the new render architecture to do that yet
    - Clears all attachment for all views: I do not know enough about rendering in general to say, whether there is a use case for not clearing
    - Does not solve #3043 as we still need Cameras/ViewTargets to clear.

    Ported WgpuOptions to bevy_render2 (#3282)
    
    # Objective
    
    The new renderer does not support any options yet for wgpu. These are needed for example for rendering wireframes (see #3193).
    
    ## Solution
    
    I've ported WgpuOptions to bevy_render2.
    
    The defaults match the defaults that were used before this PR (meaning, some specific options when target_arch = wasm32).
    
    Additionally, I removed `Auto` from WgpuBackends and added `Primary`. The default will use primary or GL based on the target_arch.

    Clustered forward rendering (#3153)
    
    # Objective
    
    Implement clustered-forward rendering.
    
    ## Solution
    
    ~~FIXME - in the interest of keeping the merge train moving, I'm submitting this PR now before the description is ready. I want to add in some comments into the code with references for the various bits and pieces and I want to describe some of the key decisions I made here. I'll do that as soon as I can.~~ Anyone reviewing is welcome to add review comments where you want to know more about how something or other works.
    
    * The summary of the technique is that the view frustum is divided into a grid of sub-volumes called clusters, point lights are tested against each of the clusters to see if they would affect that volume within the scene and if so, added to a list of lights affecting that cluster. Then when shading a fragment which is a point on the surface of a mesh within the scene, the point is mapped to a cluster and only the lights affecting that clusters are used in lighting calculations. This brings huge performance and scalability benefits as most of the time lights are placed so that there are not that many that overlap each other in terms of their sphere of influence, but there may be many distinct point lights visible in the scene. Doing all the lighting calculations for all visible lights in the scene for every pixel on the screen quickly becomes a performance limitation. Clustered forward rendering allows us to make an approximate list of lights that affect each pixel, indeed each surface in the scene (as it works along the view z axis too, unlike tiled/forward+).
    * WebGL2 is a platform we want to support and it does not support storage buffers. Uniform buffer bindings are limited to a maximum of 16384 bytes per binding. I used bit shifting and masking to pack the cluster light lists and various indices into a uniform buffer and the 16kB limit is very likely the first bottleneck in scaling the number of lights in a scene at the moment if the lights can affect many clusters due to their range or proximity to the camera (there are a lot of clusters close to the camera, which is an area for improvement). We could store the information in textures instead of uniform buffers to remove this bottleneck though I don’t know if there are performance implications to reading from textures instead if uniform buffers.
    * Because of the uniform buffer binding size limitations we can support a maximum of 256 lights with the current size of the PointLight struct
    * The z-slicing method (i.e. the mapping from view space z to a depth slice which defines the near and far planes of a cluster) is using the Doom 2016 method. I need to add comments with references to this. It’s an exponential function that simplifies well for the purposes of optimising the fragment shader. xy grid divisions are regular in screen space.
    * Some optimisation work was done on the allocation of lights to clusters, which involves intersection tests, and for this number of clusters and lights the system has insignificant cost using a fairly naïve algorithm. I think for more lights / finer-grained clusters we could use a BVH, but at some point it would be just much better to use compute shaders and storage buffers.
    * Something else to note is that it is absolutely infeasible to use plain cube map point light shadow mapping for many lights. It does not scale in terms of performance nor memory usage. There are some interesting methods I saw discussed in reference material that I will add a link to which render and update shadow maps piece-wise, but they also need compute shaders to work well. Basically for now you need to sacrifice point light shadows for all but a handful of point lights if you don’t want to kill performance. I set the limit to 10 but that’s just what we had from before where 10 was the maximum number of point lights before this PR.
    * I added a couple of debug visualisations behind a shader def that were useful for seeing performance impact of light distribution - I should make the debug mode configurable without modifying the shader code. One mode shows the number of lights affecting each cluster by tinting toward red for few lights or green for many lights (maxes out at 16, but not sure that’s a reasonable max). The other shows which cluster the surface at a fragment belongs to by tinting it with a randomish colour. This can help to understand deeper performance issues due to screen space tiles spanning multiple clusters in depth with divergent shader execution times.
    
    Also, there are more things that could be done as improvements, and I will document those somewhere (I'm not sure where will be the best place... in a todo alongside the code, a GitHub issue, somewhere else?) but I think it works well enough and brings significant performance and scalability benefits that it's worth integrating already now and then iterating on.
    * Calculate the light’s effective range based on its intensity and physical falloff and either just use this, or take the minimum of the user-supplied range and this. This would avoid unnecessary lighting calculations for clusters that cannot be affected. This would need to take into account HDR tone mapping as in my not-fully-understanding-the-details understanding, the threshold is relative to how bright the scene is.
    * Improve the z-slicing to use a larger first slice.
    * More gracefully handle the cluster light list uniform buffer binding size limitations by prioritising which lights are included (some heuristic for most significant like closest to the camera, brightest, affecting the most pixels, …)
    * Switch to using a texture instead of uniform buffer
    * Figure out the / a better story for shadows
    
    I will also probably add an example that demonstrates some of the issues:
    * What situations exhaust the space available in the uniform buffers
      * Light range too large making lights affect many clusters and so exhausting the space for the lists of lights that affect clusters
      * Light range set to be too small producing visible artifacts where clusters the light would physically affect are not affected by the light
    * Perhaps some performance issues
      * How many lights can be closely packed or affect large portions of the view before performance drops?

    Check for NaN in `Camera::world_to_screen()` (#3268)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Checks for NaN in computed NDC space coordinates, fixing unexpected NaN in a fallible (`Option<T>`) function.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Adds a NaN check, in addition to the existing NDC bounds checks.
    - This is a helper function, and should have no performance impact to the engine itself.
    - This will help prevent hard-to-trace NaN propagation in user code, by returning `None` instead of `Some(NaN)`.
    
    
    Depends on https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3269 for CI error fix.

    Default image used in PipelinedSpriteBundle to be able to render without loading a texture (#3270)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fix #3188
    - Allow creating a `PipelinedSpriteBundle` without an image, just a plain color
    
    ```rust
    PipelinedSpriteBundle {
        sprite: Sprite {
            color: Color::rgba(0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3),
            custom_size: Some(Vec2::new(500.0, 500.0)),
            ..Default::default()
        },
        ..Default::default()
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    - The default impl for `Image` was creating a one pixel image with all values at `1`. I changed it to `255` as picking `1` for it doesn't really make sense, it should be either `0` or `255`
    - I created a static handle and added the default image to the assets with this handle
    - I changed the default impl for `PipelinedSpriteBundle` to use this handle

    Fix iOS CI on Intel (for real this time) (#3232)
    
    # Objective
    
    - iOS CI has linker issues https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/runs/4388921574?check_suite_focus=true
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Building for iOS actually requires ~~both iOS SDK for target and~~ macOS SDK for build scripts. ~~I added them both when needed~~ I replaced the iOS SDK with the maOS. This was not an issue on m1 as they are compatible enough to make the build pass.
    - This completely confused `shader-sys` which fails to build in this configuration. Luckily as the example now uses the new renderer, I was able to remove the old renderer and depend no more on this lib.
    
    This is confirmed to work:
    - on intel mac with simulator
    - on m1 mac with simulator
    - on m1 mac with real iphone

    bevy_render2: Add support for #else for shader defs (#3206)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Add support for `#else` for shader defs
    
    ## Solution
    
    - When entering a scope with `#ifdef` or `#ifndef`, if the parent scope is truthy, and the shader definition is also truthy, then the a new scope is pushed onto the scope stack that is also truthy, else falsy. When encountering a subsequent else clause within a scope, if the parent is truthy and the current scope is truthy, then it should become falsy. If the parent scope is truthy and the current scope is falsy then it should become truthy. If the parent scope is falsy, then the current scope should remain falsy as the parent scope takes precedent.
    - I added a simple test for an else case.

    Implement iter() for mutable Queries (#2305)
    
    A sample implementation of how to have `iter()` work on mutable queries without breaking aliasing rules.
    
    # Objective
    
    - Fixes #753
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added a ReadOnlyFetch to WorldQuery that is the `&T` version of `&mut T` that is used to specify the return type for read only operations like `iter()`.
    - ~~As the comment suggests specifying the bound doesn't work due to restrictions on defining recursive implementations (like `Or`). However bounds on the functions are fine~~ Never mind I misread how `Or` was constructed, bounds now exist.
    - Note that the only mutable one has a new `Fetch` for readonly as the `State` has to be the same for any of this to work

    Sprite change image (#3207)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Changing the underlying image would not update a sprite
    
    ## Solution
    
    - 'Detect' if the underlying image changes to update the sprite
    
    Currently, we don't support change detection on `RenderAssets`, so we have to manually check it.
    This method at least maintains the bind groups when the image isn't changing. They were cached, so I assume that's important.
    
    This gives us correct behaviour here.

    With this, `make install` works on my m1 Mac but still fails on my intel Mac unless I run something like `make install; cargo build --target x86_64-apple-ios; make install; cargo build --target x86_64-apple-ios; make install`. It seems something is off when executing cargo through `xcodebuild` on my setup but not sure what. So this PR will probably not fix iOS CI 😞

    iOS: replace cargo-lipo, and update for new macOS  (#3109)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Remove `cargo-lipo` as [it's deprecated](https://github.com/TimNN/cargo-lipo#maintenance-status) and doesn't work on new Apple processors
    - Fix CI that will fail as soon as GitHub update the worker used by Bevy to macOS 11
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Replace `cargo-lipo` with building with the correct target
    - Setup the correct path to libraries by using `xcrun --show-sdk-path`
    - Also try and fix path to cmake in case it's not found but available through homebrew

    Fix path used by macro not considering that we can use a sub-crate (#3178)
    
    # Problem
    
    Let's say I am writting a simple bevy plugin, and I want to depend on `bevy_ecs` crate instead of depending on the full `bevy`.
    
    So I write the following:
    
    *Cargo.toml*:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bevy_ecs = { git = "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy.git", rev = "94db0176fecfac7e7e9763f2dc7458a54c105886" }
    ```
    
    *lib.rs*:
    ```rust
    use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
    
    #[derive(Debug, Default, Component)
    pub struct MyFancyComponent;
    ```
    
    So far, so good. Everything works. But let's say I want to write some examples for using my plugin. And for theses I'd like to use the `bevy` crate, so that I can write complete examples (rendering stuff, etc.) that are simple and look like what the consumer of my plugin will do (`use bevy::prelude::*` and `DefaultPlugins`)
    
    So I amend my *Cargo.toml*:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    bevy_ecs = { git = "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy.git", rev = "94db0176fecfac7e7e9763f2dc7458a54c105886" }
    
    [dev-dependencies]
    bevy = { git = "https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy.git", rev = "94db0176fecfac7e7e9763f2dc7458a54c105886", default-features = false }
    ```
    
    And that  leads to a complilation error
    
    ```
    error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared crate or module `bevy`
    ```
    
    Basically, because `bevy` is in the `dev-dependencies`, the macro (of the production code) decides to use the `bevy::ecs` path instead of `bevy_ecs`. But `bevy` is not available there.
    
    ## Solution
    
    This PR fixes the problem. I amend the macro utility responsible of finding the path of a module.
    
    If we try to find a path, we first test if this correspond to a crate that the user directly depend on. (Like, if we search for `bevy_ecs`, we first check if there is a `bevy_ecs` dependency). If yes, we can depend on that directly. Otherwise, we proceed with the existing logic (testing `bevy` and `bevy_internal`)

    - @superdump was having trouble with this loop in the GLTF loader.

    - Make it probably linear.
    - Measured times:
    - Old: 40s, new: 200ms
    
    I think there's still room for improvement. For example, I think making the nodes be in `Arc`s could be a significant gain, since currently there's duplication all the way down the tree.

    ## Solution
    
    - NOTE: This PR is on top of https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/3072
    - Add `shadows_enabled` boolean property to `PointLight` and `DirectionalLight` components.
    - Do not update the frusta for the light if shadows are disabled.
    - Do not check for visible entities for the light if shadows are disabled.
    - Do not fetch shadows for lights with shadows disabled.
    - I reworked a few types for clarity: `ViewLight` -> `ShadowView`, the bulk of `ViewLights` members -> `ViewShadowBindings`, the entities Vec in `ViewLights` -> `ViewLightEntities`, the uniform offset in `ViewLights` for `GpuLights` -> `ViewLightsUniformOffset`

    Shader Imports. Decouple Mesh logic from PBR (#3137)
    
    ## Shader Imports
    
    This adds "whole file" shader imports. These come in two flavors:
    
    ### Asset Path Imports
    
    ```rust
    // /assets/shaders/custom.wgsl
    
    #import "shaders/custom_material.wgsl"
    
    [[stage(fragment)]]
    fn fragment() -> [[location(0)]] vec4<f32> {
        return get_color();
    }
    ```
    
    ```rust
    // /assets/shaders/custom_material.wgsl
    
    [[block]]
    struct CustomMaterial {
        color: vec4<f32>;
    };
    [[group(1), binding(0)]]
    var<uniform> material: CustomMaterial;
    ```
    
    ### Custom Path Imports
    
    Enables defining custom import paths. These are intended to be used by crates to export shader functionality:
    
    ```rust
    // bevy_pbr2/src/render/pbr.wgsl
    
    #import bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bind_group
    #import bevy_pbr::mesh_bind_group
    
    [[block]]
    struct StandardMaterial {
        base_color: vec4<f32>;
        emissive: vec4<f32>;
        perceptual_roughness: f32;
        metallic: f32;
        reflectance: f32;
        flags: u32;
    };
    
    /* rest of PBR fragment shader here */
    ```
    
    ```rust
    impl Plugin for MeshRenderPlugin {
        fn build(&self, app: &mut bevy_app::App) {
            let mut shaders = app.world.get_resource_mut::<Assets<Shader>>().unwrap();
            shaders.set_untracked(
                MESH_BIND_GROUP_HANDLE,
                Shader::from_wgsl(include_str!("mesh_bind_group.wgsl"))
                    .with_import_path("bevy_pbr::mesh_bind_group"),
            );
            shaders.set_untracked(
                MESH_VIEW_BIND_GROUP_HANDLE,
                Shader::from_wgsl(include_str!("mesh_view_bind_group.wgsl"))
                    .with_import_path("bevy_pbr::mesh_view_bind_group"),
            );
    ```
    
    By convention these should use rust-style module paths that start with the crate name. Ultimately we might enforce this convention.
    
    Note that this feature implements _run time_ import resolution. Ultimately we should move the import logic into an asset preprocessor once Bevy gets support for that.
    
    ## Decouple Mesh Logic from PBR Logic via MeshRenderPlugin
    
    This breaks out mesh rendering code from PBR material code, which improves the legibility of the code, decouples mesh logic from PBR logic, and opens the door for a future `MaterialPlugin<T: Material>` that handles all of the pipeline setup for arbitrary shader materials.
    
    ## Removed `RenderAsset<Shader>` in favor of extracting shaders into RenderPipelineCache
    
    This simplifies the shader import implementation and removes the need to pass around `RenderAssets<Shader>`.
    
    ##  RenderCommands are now fallible
    
    This allows us to cleanly handle pipelines+shaders not being ready yet. We can abort a render command early in these cases, preventing bevy from trying to bind group / do draw calls for pipelines that couldn't be bound. This could also be used in the future for things like "components not existing on entities yet".
    
    # Next Steps
    
    * Investigate using Naga for "partial typed imports" (ex: `#import bevy_pbr::material::StandardMaterial`, which would import only the StandardMaterial struct)
    * Implement `MaterialPlugin<T: Material>` for low-boilerplate custom material shaders
    * Move shader import logic into the asset preprocessor once bevy gets support for that.
    
    Fixes #3132

    Add support for opaque, alpha mask, and alpha blend modes (#3072)
    
    # Objective
    
    Add depth prepass and support for opaque, alpha mask, and alpha blend modes for the 3D PBR target.
    
    ## Solution
    
    NOTE: This is based on top of #2861 frustum culling. Just lining it up to keep @cart loaded with the review train. 🚂
    
    There are a lot of important details here. Big thanks to @cwfitzgerald of wgpu, naga, and rend3 fame for explaining how to do it properly!
    
    * An `AlphaMode` component is added that defines whether a material should be considered opaque, an alpha mask (with a cutoff value that defaults to 0.5, the same as glTF), or transparent and should be alpha blended
    * Two depth prepasses are added:
      * Opaque does a plain vertex stage
      * Alpha mask does the vertex stage but also a fragment stage that samples the colour for the fragment and discards if its alpha value is below the cutoff value
      * Both are sorted front to back, not that it matters for these passes. (Maybe there should be a way to skip sorting?)
    * Three main passes are added:
      * Opaque and alpha mask passes use a depth comparison function of Equal such that only the geometry that was closest is processed further, due to early-z testing
      * The transparent pass uses the Greater depth comparison function so that only transparent objects that are closer than anything opaque are rendered
      * The opaque fragment shading is as before except that alpha is explicitly set to 1.0
      * Alpha mask fragment shading sets the alpha value to 1.0 if it is equal to or above the cutoff, as defined by glTF
      * Opaque and alpha mask are sorted front to back (again not that it matters as we will skip anything that is not equal... maybe sorting is no longer needed here?)
      * Transparent is sorted back to front. Transparent fragment shading uses the alpha blending over operator

    # Objective
    
    bevy_ecs has several compile_fail tests that assert lifetime safety. In the past, these tests have been green for the wrong reasons (see e.g. #2984). This PR makes sure, that they will fail if the compiler error changes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Use [trybuild](https://crates.io/crates/trybuild) to assert the compiler errors.
    
    The UI tests are in a separate crate that is not part of the Bevy workspace. This is to ensure that they do not break Bevy's crater builds. The tests get executed by the CI workflow on the stable toolchain.

    explain that the user must call `AssetServer::get_load_state()` to
    monitor the loading state of an asset.

    Frustum culling (#2861)
    
    # Objective
    
    Implement frustum culling for much better performance on more complex scenes. With the Amazon Lumberyard Bistro scene, I was getting roughly 15fps without frustum culling and 60+fps with frustum culling on a MacBook Pro 16 with i9 9980HK 8c/16t CPU and Radeon Pro 5500M.
    
    macOS does weird things with vsync so even though vsync was off, it really looked like sometimes other applications or the desktop window compositor were interfering, but the difference could be even more as I even saw up to 90+fps sometimes.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Until the https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/pull/12 RFC is completed, I wanted to implement at least some of the bounding volume functionality we needed to be able to unblock a bunch of rendering features and optimisations such as frustum culling, fitting the directional light orthographic projection to the relevant meshes in the view, clustered forward rendering, etc.
    - I have added `Aabb`, `Frustum`, and `Sphere` types with only the necessary intersection tests for the algorithms used. I also added `CubemapFrusta` which contains a `[Frustum; 6]` and can be used by cube maps such as environment maps, and point light shadow maps.
      - I did do a bit of benchmarking and optimisation on the intersection tests. I compared the [rafx parallel-comparison bitmask approach](https://github.com/aclysma/rafx/blob/c91bd5fcfdfa3f4d1b43507c32d84b94ffdf1b2e/rafx-visibility/src/geometry/frustum.rs#L64-L92) with a naïve loop that has an early-out in case of a bounding volume being outside of any one of the `Frustum` planes and found them to be very similar, so I chose the simpler and more readable option. I also compared using Vec3 and Vec3A and it turned out that promoting Vec3s to Vec3A improved performance of the culling significantly due to Vec3A operations using SIMD optimisations where Vec3 uses plain scalar operations.
    - When loading glTF models, the vertex attribute accessors generally store the minimum and maximum values, which allows for adding AABBs to meshes loaded from glTF for free.
    - For meshes without an AABB (`PbrBundle` deliberately does not have an AABB by default), a system is executed that scans over the vertex positions to find the minimum and maximum values along each axis. This is used to construct the AABB.
    - The `Frustum::intersects_obb` and `Sphere::insersects_obb` algorithm is from Foundations of Game Engine Development 2: Rendering by Eric Lengyel. There is no OBB type, yet, rather an AABB and the model matrix are passed in as arguments. This calculates a 'relative radius' of the AABB with respect to the plane normal (the plane normal in the Sphere case being something I came up with as the direction pointing from the centre of the sphere to the centre of the AABB) such that it can then do a sphere-sphere intersection test in practice.
    - `RenderLayers` were copied over from the current renderer.
    - `VisibleEntities` was copied over from the current renderer and a `CubemapVisibleEntities` was added to support `PointLight`s for now. `VisibleEntities` are added to views (cameras and lights) and contain a `Vec<Entity>` that is populated by culling/visibility systems that run in PostUpdate of the app world, and are iterated over in the render world for, for example, queuing up meshes to be drawn by lights for shadow maps and the main pass for cameras.
    - `Visibility` and `ComputedVisibility` components were added. The `Visibility` component is user-facing so that, for example, the entity can be marked as not visible in an editor. `ComputedVisibility` on the other hand is the result of the culling/visibility systems and takes `Visibility` into account. So if an entity is marked as not being visible in its `Visibility` component, that will skip culling/visibility intersection tests and just mark the `ComputedVisibility` as false.
    - The `ComputedVisibility` is used to decide which meshes to extract.
    - I had to add a way to get the far plane from the `CameraProjection` in order to define an explicit far frustum plane for culling. This should perhaps be optional as it is not always desired and in that case, testing 5 planes instead of 6 is a performance win.
    
    I think that's about all. I discussed some of the design with @cart on Discord already so hopefully it's not too far from being mergeable. It works well at least. 😄

    - I noticed one today that could be expanded, it seemed like a good starting point

    Longer term, there are a few more evolutions that can continue this:
    - the code samples should be compiled check, and even executed for some of them to check they have the correct error code in a panic
    - the error could be build on a page in the website like https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html
    - most panic should have their own error code

    - Refactored pbr.wgsl to share a bunch of common code between the normal map and non-normal map entry points. I tried to do this in a way that will allow custom shader reuse.

    Sprite Batching (#3060)
    
    This implements the following:
    
    * **Sprite Batching**: Collects sprites in a vertex buffer to draw many sprites with a single draw call. Sprites are batched by their `Handle<Image>` within a specific z-level. When possible, sprites are opportunistically batched _across_ z-levels (when no sprites with a different texture exist between two sprites with the same texture on different z levels). With these changes, I can now get ~130,000 sprites at 60fps on the `bevymark_pipelined` example.
    * **Sprite Color Tints**: The `Sprite` type now has a `color` field. Non-white color tints result in a specialized render pipeline that passes the color in as a vertex attribute. I chose to specialize this because passing vertex colors has a measurable price (without colors I get ~130,000 sprites on bevymark, with colors I get ~100,000 sprites). "Colored" sprites cannot be batched with "uncolored" sprites, but I think this is fine because the chance of a "colored" sprite needing to batch with other "colored" sprites is generally probably way higher than an "uncolored" sprite needing to batch with a "colored" sprite.
    * **Sprite Flipping**: Sprites can be flipped on their x or y axis using `Sprite::flip_x` and `Sprite::flip_y`. This is also true for `TextureAtlasSprite`.
    * **Simpler BufferVec/UniformVec/DynamicUniformVec Clearing**:  improved the clearing interface by removing the need to know the size of the final buffer at the initial clear.

    Note that this moves sprites away from entity-driven rendering and back to extracted lists. We _could_ use entities here, but it necessitates that an intermediate list is allocated / populated to collect and sort extracted sprites. This redundant copy, combined with the normal overhead of spawning extracted sprite entities, brings bevymark down to ~80,000 sprites at 60fps. I think making sprites a bit more fixed (by default) is worth it. I view this as acceptable because batching makes normal entity-driven rendering pretty useless anyway (and we would want to batch most custom materials too). We can still support custom shaders with custom bindings, we'll just need to define a specific interface for it.

    Add MSAA to new renderer  (#3042)
    
    Adds support for MSAA to the new renderer. This is done using the new [pipeline specialization](#3031) support to specialize on sample count. This is an alternative implementation to #2541 that cuts out the need for complicated render graph edge management by moving the relevant target information into View entities. This reuses @superdump's clever MSAA bitflag range code from #2541.
    
    Note that wgpu currently only supports 1 or 4 samples due to those being the values supported by WebGPU. However they do plan on exposing ways to [enable/query for natively supported sample counts](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/1832). When this happens we should integrate

    Add support for IndexFormat::Uint16 (#2990)
    
    # Objective
    
    while testing wgpu/WebGL on mobile GPU I've noticed bevy always forces vertex index format to 32bit (and ignores mesh settings).
    
    ## Solution
    
    the solution is to pass proper vertex index format in GpuIndexInfo to render_pass

    Pipeline Specialization, Shader Assets, and Shader Preprocessing (#3031)
    
    ## New Features
    This adds the following to the new renderer:
    
    * **Shader Assets**
      * Shaders are assets again! Users no longer need to call `include_str!` for their shaders
      * Shader hot-reloading
    * **Shader Defs / Shader Preprocessing**
      * Shaders now support `# ifdef NAME`, `# ifndef NAME`, and `# endif` preprocessor directives
    * **Bevy RenderPipelineDescriptor and RenderPipelineCache**
      * Bevy now provides its own `RenderPipelineDescriptor` and the wgpu version is now exported as `RawRenderPipelineDescriptor`. This allows users to define pipelines with `Handle<Shader>` instead of needing to manually compile and reference `ShaderModules`, enables passing in shader defs to configure the shader preprocessor, makes hot reloading possible (because the descriptor can be owned and used to create new pipelines when a shader changes), and opens the doors to pipeline specialization.
      * The `RenderPipelineCache` now handles compiling and re-compiling Bevy RenderPipelineDescriptors. It has internal PipelineLayout and ShaderModule caches. Users receive a `CachedPipelineId`, which can be used to look up the actual `&RenderPipeline` during rendering.
    * **Pipeline Specialization**
      * This enables defining per-entity-configurable pipelines that specialize on arbitrary custom keys. In practice this will involve specializing based on things like MSAA values, Shader Defs, Bind Group existence, and Vertex Layouts.
      * Adds a `SpecializedPipeline` trait and `SpecializedPipelines<MyPipeline>` resource. This is a simple layer that generates Bevy RenderPipelineDescriptors based on a custom key defined for the pipeline.
      * Specialized pipelines are also hot-reloadable.
      * This was the result of experimentation with two different approaches:
        1. **"generic immediate mode multi-key hash pipeline specialization"**
          * breaks up the pipeline into multiple "identities" (the core pipeline definition, shader defs, mesh layout, bind group layout). each of these identities has its own key. looking up / compiling a specific version of a pipeline requires composing all of these keys together
          * the benefit of this approach is that it works for all pipelines / the pipeline is fully identified by the keys. the multiple keys allow pre-hashing parts of the pipeline identity where possible (ex: pre compute the mesh identity for all meshes)
          * the downside is that any per-entity data that informs the values of these keys could require expensive re-hashes. computing each key for each sprite tanked bevymark performance (sprites don't actually need this level of specialization yet ... but things like pbr and future sprite scenarios might).
          * this is the approach rafx used last time i checked
        2. **"custom key specialization"**
          * Pipelines by default are not specialized
          * Pipelines that need specialization implement a SpecializedPipeline trait with a custom key associated type
          * This allows specialization keys to encode exactly the amount of information required (instead of needing to be a combined hash of the entire pipeline). Generally this should fit in a small number of bytes. Per-entity specialization barely registers anymore on things like bevymark. It also makes things like "shader defs" way cheaper to hash because we can use context specific bitflags instead of strings.
          * Despite the extra trait, it actually generally makes pipeline definitions + lookups simpler: managing multiple keys (and making the appropriate calls to manage these keys) was way more complicated.
      * I opted for custom key specialization. It performs better generally and in my opinion is better UX. Fortunately the way this is implemented also allows for custom caches as this all builds on a common abstraction: the RenderPipelineCache. The built in custom key trait is just a simple / pre-defined way to interact with the cache
    
    ## Callouts
    
    * The SpecializedPipeline trait makes it easy to inherit pipeline configuration in custom pipelines. The changes to `custom_shader_pipelined` and the new `shader_defs_pipelined` example illustrate how much simpler it is to define custom pipelines based on the PbrPipeline.
    * The shader preprocessor is currently pretty naive (it just uses regexes to process each line). Ultimately we might want to build a more custom parser for more performance + better error handling, but for now I'm happy to optimize for "easy to implement and understand".
    
    ## Next Steps
    
    * Port compute pipelines to the new system
    * Add more preprocessor directives (else, elif, import)
    * More flexible vertex attribute specialization / enable cheaply specializing on specific mesh vertex layouts

    Update to edition 2021 on master (#3028)
    
    Objective
    During work on #3009 I've found that not all jobs use actions-rs, and therefore, an previous version of Rust is used for them. So while compilation and other stuff can pass, checking markup and Android build may fail with compilation errors.
    
    Solution
    This PR adds `action-rs` for any job running cargo, and updates the edition to 2021.

    - Bevy has several `compile_fail` test

    #2605 changed the lifetime annotations on `get_component` introducing unsoundness as you could keep the returned borrow even after using the query.
    
    Example unsoundness:
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    
    fn main() {
        App::new()
            .add_startup_system(startup)
            .add_system(unsound)
            .run();
    }
    
    #[derive(Debug, Component, PartialEq, Eq)]
    struct Foo(Vec<u32>);
    
    fn startup(mut c: Commands) {
        let e = c.spawn().insert(Foo(vec![10])).id();
        c.insert_resource(e);
    }
    
    fn unsound(mut q: Query<&mut Foo>, res: Res<Entity>) {
        let foo = q.get_component::<Foo>(*res).unwrap();
        let mut foo2 = q.iter_mut().next().unwrap();
    
        let first_elem = &foo.0[0];

            foo2.0.push(12);
        }

    Add entity ID to expect() message (#2943)
    
    Add the entity ID and generation to the expect() message of two
    world accessors, to make it easier to debug use-after-free issues.
    Coupled with e.g. bevy-inspector-egui which also displays the entity ID,
    this makes it much easier to identify what entity is being misused.
    
    # Objective
    
    Make it easier to identity an entity being accessed after being deleted.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Augment the error message of some `expect()` call with the entity ID and
    generation. Combined with some external tool like `bevy-inspector-egui`, which
    also displays the entity ID, this increases the chances to be able to identify
    the entity, and therefore find the error that led to a use-after-despawn.

    Avoid some format! into immediate format! (#2913)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Avoid usages of `format!` that ~immediately get passed to another `format!`. This avoids a temporary allocation and is just generally cleaner.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - `bevy_derive::shader_defs` does a `format!("{}", val.to_string())`, which is better written as just `format!("{}", val)`
    - `bevy_diagnostic::log_diagnostics_plugin` does a `format!("{:>}", format!(...))`, which is better written as `format!("{:>}", format_args!(...))`
    - `bevy_ecs::schedule` does `tracing::info!(..., name = &*format!("{:?}", val))`, which is better written with the tracing shorthand `tracing::info!(..., name = ?val)`
    - `bevy_reflect::reflect` does `f.write_str(&format!(...))`, which is better written as `write!(f, ...)` (this could also be written using `f.debug_tuple`, but I opted to maintain alt debug behavior)
    - `bevy_reflect::serde::{ser, de}` do `serde::Error::custom(format!(...))`, which is better written as `Error::custom(format_args!(...))`, as `Error::custom` takes `impl Display` and just immediately calls `format!` again

    Implement and require `#[derive(Component)]` on all component structs (#2254)
    
    This implements the most minimal variant of #1843 - a derive for marker trait. This is a prerequisite to more complicated features like statically defined storage type or opt-out component reflection.
    
    In order to make component struct's purpose explicit and avoid misuse, it must be annotated with `#[derive(Component)]` (manual impl is discouraged for compatibility). Right now this is just a marker trait, but in the future it might be expanded. Making this change early allows us to make further changes later without breaking backward compatibility for derive macro users.
    
    This already prevents a lot of issues, like using bundles in `insert` calls. Primitive types are no longer valid components as well. This can be easily worked around by adding newtype wrappers and deriving `Component` for them.
    
    One funny example of prevented bad code (from our own tests) is when an newtype struct or enum variant is used. Previously, it was possible to write `insert(Newtype)` instead of `insert(Newtype(value))`. That code compiled, because function pointers (in this case newtype struct constructor) implement `Send + Sync + 'static`, so we allowed them to be used as components. This is no longer the case and such invalid code will trigger a compile error.

    Unique WorldId (#2827)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes these issues:
    - `WorldId`s currently aren't necessarily unique
        - I want to guarantee that they're unique to safeguard my librarified version of https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/2805
        - There probably hasn't been a collision yet, but they could technically collide
    - `SystemId` isn't used for anything
      - It's no longer used now that `Locals` are stored within the `System`.
    - `bevy_ecs` depends on rand
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Instead of randomly generating `WorldId`s, just use an incrementing atomic counter, panicing on overflow.
    - Remove `SystemId`
        - We do need to allow Locals for exclusive systems at some point, but exclusive systems couldn't access their own `SystemId` anyway.
    - Now that these don't depend on rand, move it to a dev-dependency
    
    ## Todo
    
    Determine if `WorldId` should be `u32` based instead

    Add set_stencil_reference to TrackedRenderPass (#2885)
    
    `TrackedRenderPass` is a wrapper around wgpu's `RenderPass` and should expose needed methods such as `set_stencil_reference`.

    add_texture returns index to texture (#2864)
    
    If you need to build a texture atlas from an already created texture that is not match a grid, you need to use new_empty and add_texture to create it.  However it is not straight forward to get the index to be used with TextureAtlasSprite. add_texture should be changed to return the index to the texture.
    
    Currently you can do something like this:
    
    ```rs
    let texture = asset_server.load::<Texture>::("texture.png");
    let texture_atlas = TextureAtlas::new_empty(texture, Vec2::new(40.0, 40.0));
    
    texture_atlas.add_texture(Rect {
      min: Vec2::new(20.0, 20.0),
      max: Vec2::new(40.0, 40.0),
    });
    let index = (texture_atlas.len() - 1) as u32;
    
    let texture_atlas_sprite = TextureAtlasSprite {
      index,
      Default::default()
    };
    ```
    
    But this is more clear
    ```rs
    let index = texture_atlas.add_texture(Rect {
      min: Vec2::new(20.0, 20.0),
      max: Vec2::new(40.0, 40.0),
    });
    ```

    Fix window size change panic (#2858)
    
    # Objective
    
    Using fullscreen or trying to resize a window caused a panic. Fix that.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Don't wholesale overwrite the ExtractedWindows resource when extracting windows
      - This could cause an accumulation of unused windows that are holding onto swap chain frames?
    - Check the if width and/or height changed since the last frame
    - If the size changed, recreate the swap chain
    - Ensure dimensions are >= 1 to avoid panics due to any dimension being 0

    Modular Rendering (#2831)
    
    This changes how render logic is composed to make it much more modular. Previously, all extraction logic was centralized for a given "type" of rendered thing. For example, we extracted meshes into a vector of ExtractedMesh, which contained the mesh and material asset handles, the transform, etc. We looked up bindings for "drawn things" using their index in the `Vec<ExtractedMesh>`. This worked fine for built in rendering, but made it hard to reuse logic for "custom" rendering. It also prevented us from reusing things like "extracted transforms" across contexts.
    
    To make rendering more modular, I made a number of changes:
    
    * Entities now drive rendering:
      * We extract "render components" from "app components" and store them _on_ entities. No more centralized uber lists! We now have true "ECS-driven rendering"
      * To make this perform well, I implemented #2673 in upstream Bevy for fast batch insertions into specific entities. This was merged into the `pipelined-rendering` branch here: #2815
    * Reworked the `Draw` abstraction:
      * Generic `PhaseItems`: each draw phase can define its own type of "rendered thing", which can define its own "sort key"
      * Ported the 2d, 3d, and shadow phases to the new PhaseItem impl (currently Transparent2d, Transparent3d, and Shadow PhaseItems)
      * `Draw` trait and and `DrawFunctions` are now generic on PhaseItem
      * Modular / Ergonomic `DrawFunctions` via `RenderCommands`
        * RenderCommand is a trait that runs an ECS query and produces one or more RenderPass calls. Types implementing this trait can be composed to create a final DrawFunction. For example the DrawPbr DrawFunction is created from the following DrawCommand tuple. Const generics are used to set specific bind group locations:
            ```rust
             pub type DrawPbr = (
                SetPbrPipeline,
                SetMeshViewBindGroup<0>,
                SetStandardMaterialBindGroup<1>,
                SetTransformBindGroup<2>,
                DrawMesh,
            );
            ```
        * The new `custom_shader_pipelined` example illustrates how the commands above can be reused to create a custom draw function:
           ```rust
           type DrawCustom = (
               SetCustomMaterialPipeline,
               SetMeshViewBindGroup<0>,
               SetTransformBindGroup<2>,
               DrawMesh,
           );
           ```
    * ExtractComponentPlugin and UniformComponentPlugin:
      * Simple, standardized ways to easily extract individual components and write them to GPU buffers
    * Ported PBR and Sprite rendering to the new primitives above.
    * Removed staging buffer from UniformVec in favor of direct Queue usage
      * Makes UniformVec much easier to use and more ergonomic. Completely removes the need for custom render graph nodes in these contexts (see the PbrNode and view Node removals and the much simpler call patterns in the relevant Prepare systems).
    * Added a many_cubes_pipelined example to benchmark baseline 3d rendering performance and ensure there were no major regressions during this port. Avoiding regressions was challenging given that the old approach of extracting into centralized vectors is basically the "optimal" approach. However thanks to a various ECS optimizations and render logic rephrasing, we pretty much break even on this benchmark!
    * Lifetimeless SystemParams: this will be a bit divisive, but as we continue to embrace "trait driven systems" (ex: ExtractComponentPlugin, UniformComponentPlugin, DrawCommand), the ergonomics of `(Query<'static, 'static, (&'static A, &'static B, &'static)>, Res<'static, C>)` were getting very hard to bear. As a compromise, I added "static type aliases" for the relevant SystemParams. The previous example can now be expressed like this: `(SQuery<(Read<A>, Read<B>)>, SRes<C>)`. If anyone has better ideas / conflicting opinions, please let me know!
    * RunSystem trait: a way to define Systems via a trait with a SystemParam associated type. This is used to implement the various plugins mentioned above. I also added SystemParamItem and QueryItem type aliases to make "trait stye" ecs interactions nicer on the eyes (and fingers).
    * RenderAsset retrying: ensures that render assets are only created when they are "ready" and allows us to create bind groups directly inside render assets (which significantly simplified the StandardMaterial code). I think ultimately we should swap this out on "asset dependency" events to wait for dependencies to load, but this will require significant asset system changes.
    * Updated some built in shaders to account for missing MeshUniform fields

    Improve bevy_ecs and bevy_app API docs where referenced by the new Bevy Book (#2365)
    
    ## Objective
    
    The upcoming Bevy Book makes many references to the API documentation of bevy.
    
    Most references belong to the first two chapters of the Bevy Book:
    
    - bevyengine/bevy-website#176
    - bevyengine/bevy-website#182
    
    This PR attempts to improve the documentation of `bevy_ecs` and `bevy_app` in order to help readers of the Book who want to delve deeper into technical details.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add crate and level module documentation
    - Document the most important items (basically those included in the preludes), with the following style, where applicable:
        - **Summary.** Short description of the item.
        - **Second paragraph.** Detailed description of the item, without going too much in the implementation.
        - **Code example(s).**
        - **Safety or panic notes.**
    
    ## Collaboration
    
    Any kind of collaboration is welcome, especially corrections, wording, new ideas and guidelines on where the focus should be put in.

    Add trace_tracy feature for Tracy profiling (#2832)
    
    # Objective
    
    [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) is:
    > A real time, nanosecond resolution, remote telemetry, hybrid frame and sampling profiler for games and other applications.
    
    With the `trace_tracy` feature enabled, you run your bevy app and either a headless server (`capture`) or a live, interactive profiler UI (`Tracy`), and connect that to your bevy application to then stream the metric data and events, and save it or inspect it live/offline.
    
    Previously when I implemented the spans across systems and stages and I was trying out different profiling tools, Tracy was too unstable on macOS to use. But now, quite some months later, it is working stably with Tracy 0.7.8. You can see timelines, aggregate statistics of mean system/stage execution times, and much more. It's very useful!
    
    ![Screenshot_2021-09-15_at_18 07 19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/302146/133554920-350d3d45-fbb8-479f-91f7-7a7a4f9f5873.png)
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use the `tracing-tracy` crate which supports our tracing spans
    - Expose via the non-default feature `trace_tracy` for consistency with other `trace*` features

    Add upstream bevy_ecs and prepare for custom-shaders merge  (#2815)
    
    This updates the `pipelined-rendering` branch to use the latest `bevy_ecs` from `main`. This accomplishes a couple of goals:
    
    1. prepares for upcoming `custom-shaders` branch changes, which were what drove many of the recent bevy_ecs changes on `main`
    2. prepares for the soon-to-happen merge of `pipelined-rendering` into `main`. By including bevy_ecs changes now, we make that merge simpler / easier to review.
    
    I split this up into 3 commits:
    
    1. **add upstream bevy_ecs**: please don't bother reviewing this content. it has already received thorough review on `main` and is a literal copy/paste of the relevant folders (the old folders were deleted so the directories are literally exactly the same as `main`).
    2. **support manual buffer application in stages**: this is used to enable the Extract step. we've already reviewed this once on the `pipelined-rendering` branch, but its worth looking at one more time in the new context of (1).
    3. **support manual archetype updates in QueryState**: same situation as (2).

    add get_single variant (#2793)
    
    # Objective
    
    The vast majority of `.single()` usage I've seen is immediately followed by a `.unwrap()`. Since it seems most people use it without handling the error, I think making it easier to just get what you want fast while also having a more verbose alternative when you want to handle the error could help.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Instead of having a lot of `.unwrap()` everywhere, this PR introduces a `try_single()` variant that behaves like the current `.single()` and make the new `.single()` panic on error.

    Improve many sprites example (#2785)
    
    # Objective
    
    My attempt at fixing #2075 .
    
    This is my very first contribution to this repo. Also, I'm very new to both Rust and bevy, so any feedback is *deeply* appreciated.
    
    ## Solution
    - Changed `move_camera_system` so it only targets the camera entity. My approach here differs from the one used in the [cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/cookbook/cursor2world.html?highlight=maincamera#2d-games) (in which a marker component is used to track the camera), so please, let me know which of them is more idiomatic.
    - `move_camera_system` does not require both `Position` and `Transform` anymore (I used `rotate` for rotating the `Transform` in place, but couldn't find an equivalent `translate` method).
    - Changed `tick_system` so it only targets the timer entity.
    - Sprites are now spawned via a single `spawn_batch` instead of multiple `spawn`s.

    # Objective
    
    Make it easier to construct transforms. E.g.
    
    ```rs
    Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 0.0, 10.0).with_scale(Vec3::splat(2.0))
    ```
    
    I found myself writing an extension method to do this so I don't have to write:
    
    ```rs
    Transform {
      translation: Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, 10.0),
      scale: Vec3::splat(2.0),
      ..Default::default()
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add *builder style* methods to `Transform`.
    
    Methods:
    
    - `with_translation`
    - `with_rotation`
    - `with_scale`
    
    I also added these methods to `GlobalTransform`. But they are probably less useful there.

    Docs/more nixos instructions (#2775)
    
    # Objective
    
    Expand the documentation for NixOS setups (as discussed in Discord)
    
    ## Solution
    
    Added more info to `linux_dependencies.md` about NixOS. This is based off my own experience (as documented in [this blog post](https://blog.thomasheartman.com/posts/bevy-getting-started-on-nixos)), so I can't confirm that it'll work for everyone. However, if there are further tweaks necessary, then I think that this should nevertheless work as a good starting point and should give future users an idea of what they may need to change or update.
    
    Feedback and tweaks are very welcome 😄

    Label PRs for all target branches (#2701)
    
    # Objective
    
    - All new PRs should get the "S-Needs-Triage" label. But at the moment we for example are getting quite a few PRs to the new renderer branch that do not get the label.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove the required target "main" from the workflow
    - Also removed configuration for not needed functionality of the labeler action (see [docs](https://github.com/actions/labeler#inputs))

    Add convenience methods for checking a set of inputs (#2760)
    
    # Objective
    
    Make it easier to check if some set of inputs matches a key, such as if you want to allow all of space or up or w for jumping.
    
    Currently, this requires:
    ```rust
    if keyboard.pressed(KeyCode::Space)
                || keyboard.pressed(KeyCode::Up)
                || keyboard.pressed(KeyCode::W) {
        // ...
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    Add an implementation of the helper methods, which very simply iterate through the items, used as:
    ```rust
    if keyboard.any_pressed([KeyCode::Space, KeyCode::Up, KeyCode::W]) {
    ```

    Add error messages for the spooky insertions (#2581)
    
    # Objective
    
    Sometimes, the unwraps in `entity_mut` could fail here, if the entity was despawned *before* this command was applied.
    
    The simplest case involves two command buffers:
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    fn b(mut commands1: Commands, mut commands2: Commands) {
        let id = commands2.spawn().insert_bundle(()).id();
        commands1.entity(id).despawn();
    }
    fn main() {
        App::build().add_system(b.system()).run();
    }
    ```
    
    However, a more complicated version arises in the case of ambiguity:
    
    ```rust
    use std::time::Duration;
    
    use bevy::{app::ScheduleRunnerPlugin, prelude::*};
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn cleanup(mut e: ResMut<Option<Entity>>) {
        *e = None;
    }
    
    fn sleep_randomly() {
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(rng.gen_range(0..50)));
    }
    
    fn spawn(mut commands: Commands, mut e: ResMut<Option<Entity>>) {
        *e = Some(commands.spawn().insert_bundle(()).id());
    }
    
    fn despawn(mut commands: Commands, e: Res<Option<Entity>>) {
        let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(rng.gen_range(0..50)));
        if let Some(e) = *e {
            commands.entity(e).despawn();
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        App::build()
            .add_system(cleanup.system().label("cleanup"))
            .add_system(sleep_randomly.system().label("before_despawn"))
            .add_system(despawn.system().after("cleanup").after("before_despawn"))
            .add_system(sleep_randomly.system().label("before_spawn"))
            .add_system(spawn.system().after("cleanup").after("before_spawn"))
            .insert_resource(None::<Entity>)
            .add_plugin(ScheduleRunnerPlugin::default())
            .run();
    }
    ```
    
    In the cases where this example crashes, it's because `despawn` was ordered before `spawn` in the topological ordering of systems (which determines when buffers are applied). However, `despawn` actually ran *after* `spawn`, because these systems are ambiguous, so the jiggles in the sleeping time triggered a case where this works.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Give a better error message

    Fix `Option<NonSend<T>>` to work when T isn't `Send`
    Fix `Option<NonSendMut<T>>` to work when T isnt in the world.

    Simple two row fix, properly initialize T in `OptionNonSendState` and remove `T: Component` bound for `Option<NonSendMut<T>>`

    Derive thiserror::Error for HexColorError (#2740)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Make it easy to use HexColorError with `thiserror`, i.e. converting it into other error types.
    
    Makes this possible:
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
    pub enum LdtkError {
        #[error("An error occured while deserializing")]
        Json(#[from] serde_json::Error),
        #[error("An error occured while parsing a color")]
        HexColor(#[from] bevy::render::color::HexColorError),
    }
    ```
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Derive thiserror::Error the same way we do elsewhere (see query.rs for instance)

    Use the infinite reverse right-handed perspective projection (#2543)
    
    # Objective
    
    Forward perspective projections have poor floating point precision distribution over the depth range. Reverse projections fair much better, and instead of having to have a far plane, with the reverse projection, using an infinite far plane is not a problem. The infinite reverse perspective projection has become the industry standard. The renderer rework is a great time to migrate to it.
    
    ## Solution
    
    All perspective projections, including point lights, have been moved to using `glam::Mat4::perspective_infinite_reverse_rh()` and so have no far plane. As various depth textures are shared between orthographic and perspective projections, a quirk of this PR is that the near and far planes of the orthographic projection are swapped when the Mat4 is computed. This has no impact on 2D/3D orthographic projection usage, and provides consistency in shaders, texture clear values, etc. throughout the codebase.
    
    ## Known issues
    
    For some reason, when looking along -Z, all geometry is black. The camera can be translated up/down / strafed left/right and geometry will still be black. Moving forward/backward or rotating the camera away from looking exactly along -Z causes everything to work as expected.
    
    I have tried to debug this issue but both in macOS and Windows I get crashes when doing pixel debugging. If anyone could reproduce this and debug it I would be very grateful. Otherwise I will have to try to debug it further without pixel debugging, though the projections and such all looked fine to me.

    Spawn specific entities: spawn or insert operations, refactor spawn internals, world clearing (#2673)
    
    This upstreams the code changes used by the new renderer to enable cross-app Entity reuse:
    
    * Spawning at specific entities
    * get_or_spawn: spawns an entity if it doesn't already exist and returns an EntityMut
    * insert_or_spawn_batch: the batched equivalent to `world.get_or_spawn(entity).insert_bundle(bundle)`
    * Clearing entities and storages
    * Allocating Entities with "invalid" archetypes. These entities cannot be queried / are treated as "non existent". They serve as "reserved" entities that won't show up when calling `spawn()`. They must be "specifically spawned at" using apis like `get_or_spawn(entity)`.
    
    In combination, these changes enable the "render world" to clear entities / storages each frame and reserve all "app world entities". These can then be spawned during the "render extract step".
    
    This refactors "spawn" and "insert" code in a way that I think is a massive improvement to legibility and re-usability. It also yields marginal performance wins by reducing some duplicate lookups (less than a percentage point improvement on insertion benchmarks). There is also some potential for future unsafe reduction (by making BatchSpawner and BatchInserter generic). But for now I want to cut down generic usage to a minimum to encourage smaller binaries and faster compiles.
    
    This is currently a draft because it needs more tests (although this code has already had some real-world testing on my custom-shaders branch).
    
    I also fixed the benchmarks (which currently don't compile!) / added new ones to illustrate batching wins.
    
    After these changes, Bevy ECS is basically ready to accommodate the new renderer. I think the biggest missing piece at this point is "sub apps".

    Pipelined separate shadow vertex shader (#2727)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Avoid unnecessary work in the vertex shader of the numerous shadow passes
    - Have the natural order of bind groups in the pbr shader: view, material, mesh
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Separate out the vertex stage of pbr.wgsl into depth.wgsl
    - Remove the unnecessary calculation of uv and normal, as well as removing the unnecessary vertex inputs and outputs
    - Use the depth.wgsl for shadow passes
    - Reorder the bind groups in pbr.wgsl and PbrShaders to be 0 - view, 1 - material, 2 - mesh in decreasing order of rebind frequency

    bevy_pbr2: Add support for not casting/receiving shadows (#2726)
    
    # Objective
    
    Allow marking meshes as not casting / receiving shadows.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Added `NotShadowCaster` and `NotShadowReceiver` zero-sized type components.
    - Extract these components into `bool`s in `ExtractedMesh`
    - Only generate `DrawShadowMesh` `Drawable`s for meshes _without_ `NotShadowCaster`
    - Add a `u32` bit `flags` member to `MeshUniform` with one flag indicating whether the mesh is a shadow receiver
    - If a mesh does _not_ have the `NotShadowReceiver` component, then it is a shadow receiver, and so the bit in the `MeshUniform` is set, otherwise it is not set.
    - Added an example illustrating the functionality.
    
    NOTE: I wanted to have the default state of a mesh as being a shadow caster and shadow receiver, hence the `Not*` components. However, I am on the fence about this. I don't want to have a negative performance impact, nor have people wondering why their custom meshes don't have shadows because they forgot to add `ShadowCaster` and `ShadowReceiver` components, but I also really don't like the double negatives the `Not*` approach incurs. What do you think?

    bevy_pbr2: Add support for configurable shadow map sizes (#2700)
    
    # Objective
    
    Add support for configurable shadow map sizes
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add `DirectionalLightShadowMap` and `PointLightShadowMap` resources, which just have size members, to the app world, and add `Extracted*` counterparts to the render world
    - Use the configured sizes when rendering shadow maps
    - Default sizes remain the same - 4096 for directional light shadow maps, 1024 for point light shadow maps (which are cube maps so 6 faces at 1024x1024 per light)

    derive Debug, Clone for FixedState (StableAHash) (#2694)
    
    This matches `ahash::RandomState`, which provides both `Debug` and `Clone`.
    
    Notably, implementing `Clone` allows the `StableHashMap`/`Set` to also implement `Clone`.
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow `bevy_utils::StableHashMap` to be cloned.
    
    ## Solution

    bevy_pbr2: Improve lighting units and documentation (#2704)
    
    # Objective
    
    A question was raised on Discord about the units of the `PointLight` `intensity` member.
    
    After digging around in the bevy_pbr2 source code and [Google Filament documentation](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html#mjx-eqn-pointLightLuminousPower) I discovered that the intention by Filament was that the 'intensity' value for point lights would be in lumens. This makes a lot of sense as these are quite relatable units given basically all light bulbs I've seen sold over the past years are rated in lumens as people move away from thinking about how bright a bulb is relative to a non-halogen incandescent bulb.
    
    However, it seems that the derivation of the conversion between luminous power (lumens, denoted `Φ` in the Filament formulae) and luminous intensity (lumens per steradian, `I` in the Filament formulae) was missed and I can see why as it is tucked right under equation 58 at the link above. As such, while the formula states that for a point light, `I = Φ / 4 π` we have been using `intensity` as if it were luminous intensity `I`.
    
    Before this PR, the intensity field is luminous intensity in lumens per steradian. After this PR, the intensity field is luminous power in lumens, [as suggested by Filament](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html#table_lighttypesunits) (unfortunately the link jumps to the table's caption so scroll up to see the actual table).
    
    I appreciate that it may be confusing to call this an intensity, but I think this is intended as more of a non-scientific, human-relatable general term with a bit of hand waving so that most light types can just have an intensity field and for most of them it works in the same way or at least with some relatable value. I'm inclined to think this is reasonable rather than throwing terms like luminous power, luminous intensity, blah at users.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Documented the `PointLight` `intensity` member as 'luminous power' in units of lumens.
    - Added a table of examples relating from various types of household lighting to lumen values.
    - Added in the mapping from luminous power to luminous intensity when premultiplying the intensity into the colour before it is made into a graphics uniform.
    - Updated the documentation in `pbr.wgsl` to clarify the earlier confusion about the missing `/ 4 π`.
    - Bumped the intensity of the point lights in `3d_scene_pipelined` to 1600 lumens.

    bevy_render2: Make default near plane more sensible at 0.1 (#2703)
    
    # Objective
    
    The default perspective projection near plane being at 1 unit feels very far away if one considers units to directly map to real world units such as metres. Not being able to see anything that is closer than 1m is unnecessarily limiting. Using a default of 0.1 makes more sense as it is difficult to even focus on things closer than 10cm in the real world.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Changed the default perspective projection near plane to 0.1.

    Add ClearColor Resource to Pipelined Renderer (#2631)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow the user to set the clear color when using the pipelined renderer
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add a `ClearColor` resource that can be added to the world to configure the clear color
    
    ## Remaining Issues
    
    Currently the `ClearColor` resource is cloned from the app world to the render world every frame. There are two ways I can think of around this:
    
    1. Figure out why `app_world.is_resource_changed::<ClearColor>()` always returns `true` in the `extract` step and fix it so that we are only updating the resource when it changes
    2. Require the users to add the `ClearColor` resource to the render sub-app instead of the parent app. This is currently sub-optimal until we have labled sub-apps, and probably a helper funciton on `App` such as `app.with_sub_app(RenderApp, |app| { ... })`. Even if we had that, I think it would be more than we want the user to have to think about. They shouldn't have to know about the render sub-app I don't think.
    
    I think the first option is the best, but I could really use some help figuring out the nuance of why `is_resource_changed` is always returning true in that context.

    feat: remove_component for ReflectComponent (#2682)
    
    # Objective
    
    While implementing a plugin for my rollback networking library, I needed to load/save parts of the world. For this, I made a WorldSnapshot that works quite like the current DynamicScene. Using a TypeRegistry to register component types I want to save/load and then using ReflectComponents methods to add or apply components of the given types.
    
    However, I noticed there is no method to remove components from entities through the ReflectComponent.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I added a `remove_component` field to the `ReflectComponent` struct, as well as a `pub fn remove_component(&self, world: &mut World, entity: Entity)` to call that function in `remove_component`. This follows exactly the same pattern all other methods/fields in this struct look like.
    
    This is an example how it could be used (at least how I would use it):

    System Param Lifetime Split (#2605)
    
    # Objective
    
    Enable using exact World lifetimes during read-only access . This is motivated by the new renderer's need to allow read-only world-only queries to outlive the query itself (but still be constrained by the world lifetime).
    
    For example:
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/115b170d1f11a91146bb6d6e9684dceb8b21f786/pipelined/bevy_pbr2/src/render/mod.rs#L774
    
    ## Solution
    
    Split out SystemParam state and world lifetimes and pipe those lifetimes up to read-only Query ops (and add into_inner for Res). According to every safety test I've run so far (except one), this is safe (see the temporary safety test commit). Note that changing the mutable variants to the new lifetimes would allow aliased mutable pointers (try doing that to see how it affects the temporary safety tests).
    
    The new state lifetime on SystemParam does make `#[derive(SystemParam)]` more cumbersome (the current impl requires PhantomData if you don't use both lifetimes). We can make this better by detecting whether or not a lifetime is used in the derive and adjusting accordingly, but that should probably be done in its own pr.
    
    ## Why is this a draft?
    
    The new lifetimes break QuerySet safety in one very specific case (see the query_set system in system_safety_test). We need to solve this before we can use the lifetimes given.
    
    This is due to the fact that QuerySet is just a wrapper over Query, which now relies on world lifetimes instead of `&self` lifetimes to prevent aliasing (but in systems, each Query has its own implied lifetime, not a centralized world lifetime).  I believe the fix is to rewrite QuerySet to have its own World lifetime (and own the internal reference). This will complicate the impl a bit, but I think it is doable. I'm curious if anyone else has better ideas.
    
    Personally, I think these new lifetimes need to happen. We've gotta have a way to directly tie read-only World queries to the World lifetime. The new renderer is the first place this has come up, but I doubt it will be the last. Worst case scenario we can come up with a second `WorldLifetimeQuery<Q, F = ()>` parameter to enable these read-only scenarios, but I'd rather not add another type to the type zoo.

    Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md (#2040)
    
    [**RENDERED**](https://github.com/alice-i-cecile/bevy/blob/better-contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    
    Improves #910. As discussed in #1309, we'll need to synchronize content between this and the Bevy website in some way (and clean up the .github file perhaps?).
    
    I think doing it as a root-directory file is nicer for discovery, but that's a conversation I'm interested in having.
    
    This document is intended to be helpful to beginners to open source and Bevy, and captures what I've learned about our informal practices and values.
    
    Reviewers: I'm particularly interested in:
    - opinions on the items **What we're trying to build**, where I discuss some of the project's high-level values and goals
    - more relevant details on the `bevy` subcrates for **Getting oriented**
    - useful tricks and best practices that I missed
    - better guidance on how to contribute to the Bevy book from @cart <3

    Implement Clone for Fetches (#2641)
    
    # Objective
    
    This:
    
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    
    fn main() {
        App::new()
        .add_system(test)
        .run();
    }
    
    fn test(entities: Query<Entity>) {
        let mut combinations = entities.iter_combinations_mut();
        while let Some([e1, e2]) = combinations.fetch_next() {
            dbg!(e1);
        }
    }
    ```
    
    fails with the message "the trait bound `bevy::ecs::query::EntityFetch: std::clone::Clone` is not satisfied".
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    It works after adding the naive clone implementation to EntityFetch. I'm not super familiar with ECS internals, so I'd appreciate input on this.

    Change definition of `ScheduleRunnerPlugin` (#2606)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Allow `ScheduleRunnerPlugin` to be instantiated without curly braces. Other plugins in the library already use the semicolon syntax.
    - Currently, you have to do the following:
    ```rust
    App::build()
        .add_plugin(bevy::core::CorePlugin)
        .add_plugin(bevy::app::ScheduleRunnerPlugin {})
    ```
    - With the proposed change you can do this:
    ```rust
    App::build()
        .add_plugin(bevy::core::CorePlugin)
        .add_plugin(bevy::app::ScheduleRunnerPlugin)

    Refactor ECS to reduce the dependency on a 1-to-1 mapping between components and real rust types (#2490)
    
    # Objective
    
    There is currently a 1-to-1 mapping between components and real rust types. This means that it is impossible for multiple components to be represented by the same rust type or for a component to not have a rust type at all. This means that component types can't be defined in languages other than rust like necessary for scripting or sandboxed (wasm?) plugins.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Refactor `ComponentDescriptor` and `Bundle` to remove `TypeInfo`. `Bundle` now uses `ComponentId` instead. `ComponentDescriptor` is now always created from a rust type instead of through the `TypeInfo` indirection. A future PR may make it possible to construct a `ComponentDescriptor` from it's fields without a rust type being involved.

    Add RenderWorld to Extract step (#2555)
    
    Makes the "Render App World" directly available to Extract step systems as a `RenderWorld` resource. Prior to this, there was no way to directly read / write render world state during the Extract step. The only way to make changes was through Commands (which were applied at the end of the stage).
    
    ```rust
    // `thing` is an "app world resource".
    fn extract_thing(thing: Res<Thing>, mut render_world: ResMut<RenderWorld>) {
      render_world.insert_resource(ExtractedThing::from(thing));
    }
    ```
    
    RenderWorld makes a number of scenarios possible:
    
    * When an extract system does big allocations, it is now possible to reuse them across frames by retrieving old values from RenderWorld (at the cost of reduced parallelism from unique RenderWorld borrows).
    * Enables inserting into the same resource across multiple extract systems
    * Enables using past RenderWorld state to inform future extract state (this should generally be avoided)
    
    Ultimately this is just a subset of the functionality we want. In the future, it would be great to have "multi-world schedules" to enable fine grained parallelism on the render world during the extract step. But that is a research project that almost certainly won't make it into 0.6. This is a good interim solution that should easily port over to multi-world schedules if/when they land.

    Down with the system! (#2496)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Remove all the `.system()` possible.
    - Check for remaining missing cases.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Remove all `.system()`, fix compile errors
    - 32 calls to `.system()` remains, mostly internals, the few others should be removed after #2446

    Inline world get (#2520)
    
    # Objective
    
    While looking at the code of `World`, I noticed two basic functions (`get` and `get_mut`) that are probably called a lot and with simple code that are not `inline`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Add benchmark to check impact
    - Add `#[inline]`
    
    
    ```

    Ci stability and speed improvements (#2551)
    
    # Objective
    
    - There are a few random failures in CI, mostly due to contacting crates.io or checking for deadlinks
    - CI can take some time, more than 20 minutes for a full status
    - A clippy/format issue stops running tests on other platforms
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Use GitHub cache for cargo artefacts
      - This speeds up builds and reduce dependencies on outside world
    - Reorder and add dependencies between short jobs. They are still setup to run even if one of the dependency failed
      - This reduce the number of parallel jobs that are running for one PR. On GitHub free tier, we're limited to 20.
    - Split CI checks (format & clippy) in its own job
      - This speeds up test jobs, and allow us to not kill all platform tests for a format issue
    - Retry in case of dead links check failure
      - Internet is just that kind of place where things may seem dead at some point but back alive 5 seconds later

    Android uninstall 31 (#2533)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Related to #2514 - not sure if it's a proper fix long term
    - CI was complaining Error: Path `"/usr/local/lib/android/sdk/ndk-bundle/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android31-clang"` was not found
    - A lot of questions started popping up 10 days ago about ["android build tools 31 corrupted"](https://www.google.com/search?q=android+build+tools+31+corrupted)
      - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68387270/android-studio-error-installed-build-tools-revision-31-0-0-is-corrupted
    - Uninstalling `"build-tools;31.0.0"` doesn't seem to work, as it removes other components even though `"build-tools;30.0.3"` are available
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Uninstalling `"platforms;android-31"` seems to do the trick and `cargo-apk` stops trying to target `...31`
    
    Android is not my thing, this solution was found with a lot of trials and errors. I am not sure how long term it is, I don't know the release schedule of android build tools, or if we need to target this 31 thing. I just wanted to stop all those failed ci everywhere...

    Scale normal bias by texel size (#26)
    
    * 3d_scene_pipelined: Use a shallower directional light angle to provoke acne
    
    * cornell_box_pipelined: Remove bias tweaks
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Simplify shadow biases by moving them to linear depth
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Do not use DepthBiasState
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Do not use bilinear filtering for sampling depth textures
    
    * pbr.wgsl: Remove unnecessary comment
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Do manual shadow map depth comparisons for more flexibility
    
    * examples: Add shadow_biases_pipelined example
    
    This is useful for stress testing biases.
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Scale the point light normal bias by the shadow map texel size
    
    This allows the normal bias to be small close to the light source where the
    shadow map texel to screen texel ratio is high, but is appropriately large
    further away from the light source where the shadow map texel can easily cover
    multiple screen texels.
    
    * shadow_biases_pipelined: Add support for toggling directional / point light
    
    * shadow_biases_pipelined: Cleanup
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Scale the directional light normal bias by the shadow map texel size
    
    * shadow_biases_pipelined: Fit the orthographic projection around the scene
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Directional lights should have no shadows outside their projection
    
    Before this change, sampling a fragment position from outside the ndc volume
    would result in the return sample being clamped to the edge in x,y or possibly
    always casting a shadow for fragment positions past the orthographic
    projection's far plane.
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Fix the default directional light normal bias
    
    * Revert "bevy_pbr2: Do manual shadow map depth comparisons for more flexibility"
    
    This reverts commit 7df1bab38a42d8a33bc50ca583d4be37bd9c9f0d.
    
    * shadow_biases_pipelined: Adjust directional light normal bias in 0.1 increments
    
    * pbr.wgsl: Add a couple of clarifying comments
    
    * Revert "bevy_pbr2: Do not use bilinear filtering for sampling depth textures"
    
    This reverts commit f53baab0232ce218866a45cad6902b470f4cf2c4.
    
    * shadow_biases_pipelined: Print usage to terminal

    bevy_pbr2: Add support for most of the StandardMaterial textures (#4)
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Add support for most of the StandardMaterial textures
    
    Normal maps are not included here as they require tangents in a vertex attribute.
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Ensure RenderCommandQueue is ready for PbrShaders init
    
    * texture_pipelined: Add a light to the scene so we can see stuff
    
    * WIP bevy_pbr2: back to front sorting hack
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Uniform control flow for texture sampling in pbr.frag
    
    From 'fintelia' on the Bevy Render Rework Round 2 discussion:
    
    "My understanding is that GPUs these days never use the "execute both branches
    and select the result" strategy. Rather, what they do is evaluate the branch
    condition on all threads of a warp, and jump over it if all of them evaluate to
    false. If even a single thread needs to execute the if statement body, however,
    then the remaining threads are paused until that is completed."
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Simplify texture and sampler names
    
    The StandardMaterial_ prefix is no longer needed
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Match default 'AmbientColor' of current bevy_pbr for now
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Convert from non-linear to linear sRGB for the color uniform
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Add pbr_pipelined example
    
    * Fix view vector in pbr frag to work in ortho
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Use a 90 degree y fov and light range projection for lights
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Add AmbientLight resource
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Convert PointLight color to linear sRGB for use in fragment shader
    
    * bevy_pbr2: pbr.frag: Rename PointLight.projection to view_projection
    
    The uniform contains the view_projection matrix so this was incorrect.
    
    * bevy_pbr2: PointLight is an OmniLight as it has a radius
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Factoring out duplicated code
    
    * bevy_pbr2: Implement RenderAsset for StandardMaterial
    
    * Remove unnecessary texture and sampler clones
    
    * fix comment formatting
    
    * remove redundant Buffer:from
    
    * Don't extract meshes when their material textures aren't ready
    
    * make missing textures in the queue step an error

    Relicense Bevy under the dual MIT or Apache-2.0 license (#2509)
    
    This relicenses Bevy under the dual MIT or Apache-2.0 license. For rationale, see #2373.
    
    * Changes the LICENSE file to describe the dual license. Moved the MIT license to docs/LICENSE-MIT. Added the Apache-2.0 license to docs/LICENSE-APACHE. I opted for this approach over dumping both license files at the root (the more common approach) for a number of reasons:
      * Github links to the "first" license file (LICENSE-APACHE) in its license links (you can see this in the wgpu and rust-analyzer repos). People clicking these links might erroneously think that the apache license is the only option. Rust and Amethyst both use COPYRIGHT or COPYING files to solve this problem, but this creates more file noise (if you do everything at the root) and the naming feels way less intuitive.
      * People have a reflex to look for a LICENSE file. By providing a single license file at the root, we make it easy for them to understand our licensing approach.
      * I like keeping the root clean and noise free
      * There is precedent for putting the apache and mit license text in sub folders (amethyst)
    * Removed the `Copyright (c) 2020 Carter Anderson` copyright notice from the MIT license. I don't care about this attribution, it might make license compliance more difficult in some cases, and it didn't properly attribute other contributors. We shoudn't replace it with something like "Copyright (c) 2021 Bevy Contributors" because "Bevy Contributors" is not a legal entity. Instead, we just won't include the copyright line (which has precedent ... Rust also uses this approach).
    * Updates crates to use the new "MIT OR Apache-2.0" license value
    * Removes the old legion-transform license file from bevy_transform. bevy_transform has been its own, fully custom implementation for a long time and that license no longer applies.
    * Added a License section to the main readme
    * Updated our Bevy Plugin licensing guidelines.
    
    As a follow-up we should update the website to properly describe the new license.
    
    Closes #2373

    # Objective
    
    - CI is failing because of an android issue
    - This is blocking bors

    - Bors can ignore android failures
    - Keep android job in CI to check its status
    
    I'm not android enough to debug this one, this is a temp fix until someone knows how to fix it or it get fixed by itself with updates?

    Revert #331 (#2502)
    
    # Objective
    
    @TomBebb (other account being @TomBebbington ) proved unreachable for #2373, so we need to revert their changes for the relicense.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Revert their changes. This is only linux distro docs, so it's not critical code.
    
    If someone else wants to test `bevy` on solus to work out the set of packages independently, then we'll probably accept a PR to add these. One suggestsion would be to consider the packages required on other systems, since there is likely to be some overlap.
    
    ## Alternatives
    
    Link to this old version in the `linux_dependencies.md` file.

    Optional `.system()`, part 6 (chaining) (#2494)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Continue work of #2398 and friends.
    - Make `.system()` optional in chaining.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Slight change to `IntoChainSystem` signature and implementation.
    - Remove some usages of `.system()` in the chaining example, to verify the implementation.
    
    ---
    
    I swear, I'm not splitting these up on purpose, I just legit forgot about most of the things where `System` appears in public API, and my trait usage explorer mingles that with the gajillion internal uses.
    
    In case you're wondering what happened to part 5, #2446 ate it.

    Relicense bors checks (#2493)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently we can sometimes allow PRs by people who haven't agreed to the relicense to get merged into main.
    
    E.g. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2445
    
    ## Solution
    
    This adds a check to ensure that this doesn't happen, by ensuring that bors doesn't relicense said PRs.
    
    As a bonus, it also adds config to automatically label new PRs as needing checking, to ensure that we do the verification until we merge the new license.

    [ecs] Improve `Commands` performance (#2332)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Currently `Commands` are quite slow due to the need to allocate for each command and wrap it in a `Box<dyn Command>`.
    - For example:
    ```rust
    fn my_system(mut cmds: Commands) {
        cmds.spawn().insert(42).insert(3.14);
    }
    ```
    will have 3 separate `Box<dyn Command>` that need to be allocated and ran.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Utilize a specialized data structure keyed `CommandQueueInner`.
    - The purpose of `CommandQueueInner` is to hold a collection of commands in contiguous memory.
    - This allows us to store each `Command` type contiguously in memory and quickly iterate through them and apply the `Command::write` trait function to each element.

    docs: add hint that texture atlas padding is between tiles (#2447)
    
    I struggled with some sprite sheet animation which was like drifting from right to left.
    This PR documents the current behaviour that the padding which is used on slicing a texture into a texture atlas, is assumed to be only between tiles. In my case I had some padding also on the right side of the texture.

    Fix AssetServer::get_asset_loader deadlock (#2395)
    
    # Objective
    
    Fixes a possible deadlock between `AssetServer::get_asset_loader` / `AssetServer::add_loader`
    
    A thread could take the `extension_to_loader_index` read lock,
    and then have the `server.loader` write lock taken in add_loader
    before it can. Then add_loader can't take the extension_to_loader_index
    lock, and the program deadlocks.
    
    To be more precise:
    
    ## Step 1: Thread 1 grabs the `extension_to_loader_index` lock on lines 138..139:
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3a1867a92edc571b8f842bb1a96112dcbdceae4b/crates/bevy_asset/src/asset_server.rs#L133-L145
    
    ## Step 2: Thread 2 grabs the `server.loader` write lock on line 107:
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3a1867a92edc571b8f842bb1a96112dcbdceae4b/crates/bevy_asset/src/asset_server.rs#L103-L116
    
    ## Step 3: Deadlock, since Thread 1 wants to grab `server.loader` on line 141...:
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3a1867a92edc571b8f842bb1a96112dcbdceae4b/crates/bevy_asset/src/asset_server.rs#L133-L145
    
    ... and Thread 2 wants to grab 'extension_to_loader_index` on lines 111..112:
    
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3a1867a92edc571b8f842bb1a96112dcbdceae4b/crates/bevy_asset/src/asset_server.rs#L103-L116
    
    
    ## Solution
    
    Fixed by descoping the extension_to_loader_index lock, since
    `get_asset_loader` doesn't need to hold the read lock on the extensions map for the duration,
    just to get a copyable usize. The block might not be needed,
    I think I could have gotten away with just inserting a `copied()`
    call into the chain, but I wanted to make the reasoning clear for
    future maintainers.

    Mention creation of disjoint Querys with `Without<T>` in conflicting access Panic (#2413)
    
    # Objective
    
    Beginners semi-regularly appear on the Discord asking for help with using `QuerySet` when they have a system with conflicting data access.
    This happens because the Resulting Panic message only mentions `QuerySet` as a solution, even if in most cases `Without<T>` was enough to solve the problem.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Mention the usage of `Without<T>` to create disjoint queries as an alternative to `QuerySet`
    
    ## Open Questions
    
    - Is `disjoint` a too technical/mathematical word?
    - Should `Without<T>` be mentioned before or after `QuerySet`?
      - Before: Using `Without<T>` should be preferred and mentioning it first reinforces this for a reader.
      - After: The Panics can be very long and a Reader could skip to end and only see the `QuerySet`

    I haven't touched exclusive systems, because it looks like the only two other solutions are going back to doubling our system insertion methods, or starting to lean into stageless. The latter will invalidate the former, so I think exclusive systems should remian pariahs until stageless.
    
    I can grep & nuke `.system()` thorughout the codebase now, which might take a while, or we can do that in subsequent PR(s).

    bevy_utils: Re-introduce `with_capacity()`. (#2393)
    
    # Objective
    Re-introduce `AHashExt` and respective `with_capacity()` implementations to give a more ergonomic way to set a `HashMap` / `HashSet` capacity.
    
    As a note, this has also been discussed and agreed on issue #2115, which this PR addresses (leaving `new()` out of the `AHashExt` trait).
    
    Fixes #2115.
    
    ## Solution
    PR #1235 had removed the `AHashExt` trait and respective `with_capacity()`s implementations, leaving only the less ergonomic `HashMap::with_capacity_and_hasher(size, Default::default())` option available.
    
    This re-introduces `AHashExt` and respective `with_capacity()` implementations to give a more ergonomic way to set a `HashMap` / `HashSet` capacity.

    - Make it so that `Time` can be cloned
    - Makes it so I can clone the entire current `Time` and easily pass it to the user in [Rusty Engine](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine) instead of [doing this](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/blob/8302dc3914d5b14b730e994cca452ce8d252fec2/src/game.rs#L147-L150)

    Exclude some Branches from running CI (#2344)
    
    # Objective
    
    #2230 allowed the CI to run on every Branch of this Repo.
    But some Branches should not actually run the CI, which wastes the available capacity of CI runners.
    
    ### staging-squash-merge.tmp
    
    This Branch is used by Bors when squashing a PR.
    CI shouldn't need to run here, as the actual verification happens in the staging branch

    fix `clippy` warning failing on CI (#2353)
    
    # Objective
    
    - CI jobs are starting to fail due to `clippy::bool-assert-comparison` and `clippy::single_component_path_imports` being triggered.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Fix all uses where `asset_eq!(<condition>, <bool>)` could be replace by `assert!`
    - Move the `#[allow()]` for `single_component_path_imports` to `#![allow()]` at the start of the files.

    [assets] Fix `AssetServer::get_handle_path` (#2310)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Currently `AssetServer::get_handle_path` always returns `None` since the inner hash map is never written to.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Inside the `load_untracked` function, insert the asset path into the map.
    
    This is similar to #1290 (thanks @TheRawMeatball)

    implement DetectChanges for NonSendMut (#2326)
    
    # Objective
    
    - The `DetectChanges` trait is used for types that detect change on mutable access (such as `ResMut`, `Mut`, etc...)
    - `DetectChanges` was not implemented for `NonSendMut`
    
    ## Solution
    
    - implement `NonSendMut` in terms of `DetectChanges`

    Fix bad bounds for NonSend SystemParams (#2325)
    
    # Objective
    
    Currently, you can't call `is_added` or `is_changed` on a `NonSend` SystemParam, unless the Resource is a Component (implements `Send` and `Sync`).
    This defeats the purpose of providing change detection for NonSend Resources.
    While fixing this, I also noticed that `NonSend` does not have a bound at all on its struct.
    
    ## Solution
    
    Change the bounds of `T` to always be `'static`.

    Document FromType trait (#2323)
    
    # Objective
    
    Prevent future unnecessary mental effort spent figuring out why this trait exists and how to resolve the `TODO`.
    
    ## Solution
    
    I happened to notice this trait being used when expanding the `#[derive(Reflect)]` macro in my own crate to figure out how it worked, and noticed that there was a `TODO` comment on it because it is only used in the derive macro and thus appeared to be unused.
    
    I figured I should document my findings to prevent someone else from finding them out the hard way in the future :laughing:

    [assets] properly set `LoadState` with invalid asset extension (#2318)
    
    # Objective
    
    - Currently, when calling any of the `AssetServer`'s `load` functions, if the extension does not exist for the given path, the returned handle's load state is always `LoadState::NotLoaded`.
    - This is due to the `load_async` function early returning without properly creating a `SourceInfo` for the requested asset.
    - Fixes #2261
    
    ## Solution
    - Add the `SourceInfo` prior to checking for valid extension loaders. And set the `LoadState` to `Failed` if the according loader does not exist.

    Log errors when loading textures from a gltf file (#2260)
    
    When loading a gltf, if there is an error loading textures, it is completely ignored.
    
    This can happen for example when loading a file with `jpg` textures without the `jpeg` Bevy feature enabled.
    This PR adds `warn` logs for the few cases that can happen when loading a texture.
    
    Other possible fix would be to break on first error and returning, making the asset loading failed

    Add a readme to bevy_ecs (#2028)
    
    [RENDERED](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy/blob/ecs_readme/crates/bevy_ecs/README.md)
    
    Since I am trying to learn more about Bevy ECS at the moment, I thought this issue is a perfect fit.
    
    This PR adds a readme to the `bevy_ecs` crate containing a minimal running example of stand alone `bevy_ecs`. Unique features like customizable component storage, Resources or change detection are introduced. For each of these features the readme links to an example in a newly created examples directory inside the `bevy_esc` crate.

    Removed redundant visibility check (#2311)
    
    Since `visible_entities_system` already checks `Visiblie::is_visible` for each entity and requires it to be `true`, there's no reason to verify visibility in `PassNode::prepare` which consumes entities produced by the system.

    [assets] remove unnecessary temporary strong handles (#2304)
    
    # Objective
    
    - When creating an asset, the `update_asset_storage` function was unnecessarily creating an extraneous `Handle` to the created asset via calling `set`. This has some overhead as the `RefChange::Increment/Decrement` event was being sent.
    - A similar exteraneous handle is also created in `load_async` when loading dependencies.
    
    ## Solution
    
    - Have the implementation use `Assets::set_untracked` and `AssetServer::load_untracked` so no intermediate handle is created.

    Use cfg attribute to filter supported extensions (#2297)
    
    When implementing `AssetLoader ` you need to specify which File extensions are supported by that loader.
    Currently, Bevy always says it supports extensions that actually require activating a Feature beforehand.
    
    This PR adds cf attributes, so Bevy only tries to load those Extensions whose Features were activated.
    
    This prevents Bevy from Panicking and reports such a warning:
    ```
    Jun 02 23:05:57.139  WARN bevy_asset::asset_server: no `AssetLoader` found for the following extension: ogg
    ```
    
    This also fixes the Bug, that the `png Feature had to be activated even if you wanted to load a different image format.
    
    Fixes #640

    [ecs] implement is_empty for queries (#2271)
    
    ## Problem
    - The `Query` struct does not provide an easy way to check if it is empty.
    - Specifically, users have to use `.iter().peekable()` or `.iter().next().is_none()` which is not very ergonomic.
    - Fixes: #2270
    
    ## Solution
    - Implement an `is_empty` function for queries to more easily check if the query is empty.

    Add new SystemState and rename old SystemState to SystemMeta (#2283)
    
    This enables `SystemParams` to be used outside of function systems. Anything can create and store `SystemState`, which enables efficient "param state cached" access to `SystemParams`.
    
    It adds a `ReadOnlySystemParamFetch` trait, which enables safe `SystemState::get` calls without unique world access.
    
    I renamed the old `SystemState` to `SystemMeta` to enable us to mirror the `QueryState` naming convention (but I'm happy to discuss alternative names if people have other ideas). I initially pitched this as `ParamState`, but given that it needs to include full system metadata, that doesn't feel like a particularly accurate name.
    
    ```rust
    #[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct A(usize);
    
    #[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct B(usize);
    
    let mut world = World::default();
    world.insert_resource(A(42));
    world.spawn().insert(B(7));
    
    // we get nice lifetime elision when declaring the type on the left hand side
    let mut system_state: SystemState<(Res<A>, Query<&B>)> = SystemState::new(&mut world);
    let (a, query) = system_state.get(&world);
    assert_eq!(*a, A(42), "returned resource matches initial value");
    assert_eq!(
        *query.single().unwrap(),
        B(7),
        "returned component matches initial value"
    );
    
    // mutable system params require unique world access
    let mut system_state: SystemState<(ResMut<A>, Query<&mut B>)> = SystemState::new(&mut world);
    let (a, query) = system_state.get_mut(&mut world);
    
    // static lifetimes are required when declaring inside of structs
    struct SomeContainer {
      state: SystemState<(Res<'static, A>, Res<'static, B>)>
    }
    
    // this can be shortened using type aliases, which will be useful for complex param tuples
    type MyParams<'a> = (Res<'a, A>, Res<'a, B>);
    struct SomeContainer {
      state: SystemState<MyParams<'static>>
    }
    
    // It is the user's responsibility to call SystemState::apply(world) for parameters that queue up work
    let mut system_state: SystemState<(Commands, Query<&B>)> = SystemState::new(&mut world);
    {
      let (mut commands, query) = system_state.get(&world);
      commands.insert_resource(3.14);
    }
    system_state.apply(&mut world);
    ```
    
    ## Future Work
    
    * Actually use SystemState inside FunctionSystem. This would be trivial, but it requires FunctionSystem to wrap SystemState in Option in its current form (which complicates system metadata lookup). I'd prefer to hold off until we adopt something like the later designs linked in #1364, which enable us to contruct Systems using a World reference (and also remove the need for `.system`).
    * Consider a "scoped" approach to automatically call SystemState::apply when systems params are no longer being used (either a container type with a Drop impl, or a function that takes a closure for user logic operating on params).

    Fixes dropping empty BlobVec (#2295)
    
    When dropping the data, we originally only checked the size of an individual item instead of the size of the allocation. However with a capacity of 0, we attempt to deallocate a pointer which was not the result of allocation. That is, an item of `Layout { size_: 8, align_: 8 }` produces an array of `Layout { size_: 0, align_: 8 }` when `capacity = 0`.
    
    Fixes #2294

    [assets] fix Assets being set as 'changed' each frame (#2280)
    
    ## Objective
    - Fixes: #2275
    - `Assets` were being flagged as 'changed' each frame regardless of if the assets were actually being updated.
    
    ## Solution
    - Only have `Assets` change detection be triggered when the collection is actually modified.
    - This includes utilizing `ResMut` further down the stack instead of a `&mut Assets` directly.

    drop overwritten component data on double insert (#2227)
    
    Continuing the work on reducing the safety footguns in the code, I've removed one extra `UnsafeCell` in favour of safe `Cell` usage inisde `ComponentTicks`. That change led to discovery of misbehaving component insert logic, where data wasn't properly dropped when overwritten. Apart from that being fixed, some method names were changed to better convey the "initialize new allocation" and "replace existing allocation" semantic.
    
    Depends on #2221, I will rebase this PR after the dependency is merged. For now, review just the last commit.

    Despawn with children doesn't need to remove entities from parents children when parents are also removed (#2278)
    
    Fixes #2274
    
    When calling `despawn_recursive`, the recursive loop doesn't need to remove the entity from the children list of its parent when the parent will also be deleted
    
    Upside:
    * Removes two entity lookup per entity being recursively despawned
    
    Downside:
    * The change detection on the `Children` component of a deleted entity in the despawned hierarchy will not be triggered

    This PR also adds in assets as a directory reference and avoids the "Xcode is optimizing and breaking my PNGs" issue that I had earlier on during iOS testing on Bevy.
    
    Re-testing this now.

    # Internal File/Link Consistency checker Action
    
    This pull request adds an action to the CI that parses the [`./examples`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/examples) folder for files and cross references that with the links listed in [`README.md`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/README.md) and [`Cargo.toml`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/Cargo.toml) to ensure the documentation actually reflects the examples currently in the repo.
    
    The primary reason for why we want this, is to prevent people from adding new examples but forgetting to also list them in the docs, or accidentally entering broken links (typos in docs).

    reduce tricky unsafety and simplify table structure (#2221)
    
    I've noticed that we are overusing interior mutability of the Table data, where in many cases we already own a unique reference to it. That prompted a slight refactor aiming to reduce number of safety constraints that must be manually upheld. Now the majority of those are just about avoiding bound checking, which is relatively easy to prove right.
    
    Another aspect is reducing the complexity of Table struct. Notably, we don't ever use archetypes stored there, so this whole thing goes away. Capacity and grow amount were mostly superficial, as we are already using Vecs inside anyway, so I've got rid of those too. Now the overall table capacity is being driven by the internal entity Vec capacity. This has a side effect of automatically implementing exponential growth pattern for BitVecs reallocations inside Table, which to my measurements slightly improves performance in tests that are heavy on inserts. YMMV, but I hope that those tests were at least remotely correct.

    Optimize Events::extend and impl std::iter::Extend (#2207)
    
    The previous implementation of `Events::extend` iterated through each event and manually `sent` it via `Events:;send`.
    However, this could be a minor performance hit since calling `Vec::push` in a loop is not optimal.
    This refactors the code to use `Vec::extend`.

    Fix Events::<drain/clear> bug (#2206)
    
    Taken from #2145
    
    On draining and clearing, dangling `EventReaders` would not read into the correct event offset.

    update duplicate dependencies after winit update (#2212)
    
    After winit update in #2186, a bunch of duplicated dependencies changed.
    
    Most are related to a new dependency, https://github.com/onurzdg/mio-misc, that has a few older versions in its dependencies

    Expose set_changed() on ResMut and Mut (#2208)
    
    This new api stems from this [discord conversation](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/742569353878437978/844057268172357663).
    
    This exposes a public facing `set_changed` method on `ResMut` and `Mut`.
    
    As a side note: `ResMut` and `Mut` have a lot of duplicated code, I have a PR I may put up later that refactors these commonalities into a trait.

    small ecs cleanup and remove_bundle drop bugfix (#2172)
    
    - simplified code around archetype generations a little bit, as the special case value is not actually needed
    - removed unnecessary UnsafeCell around pointer value that is never updated through shared references
    - fixed and added a test for correct drop behaviour when removing sparse components through remove_bundle command

    Document what `Config` is and how to use it. (#2185)
    
    While trying to figure out how to implement a `SystemParam`, I spent a
    long time looking for a feature that would do exactly what `Config`
    does.  I ignored it at first because all the examples I could find used
    `()` and I couldn't see a way to modify it.
    
    This is documented in other places, but `Config` is a logical place to
    include some breadcrumbs.  I've added some text that gives a brief
    overview of what `Config` is for, and links to the existing docs on
    `FunctionSystem::config` for more details.
    
    This would have saved me from embarrassing myself by filing https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2178.

    Add a method `iter_combinations` on query to iterate over combinations of query results (#1763)
    
    Related to [discussion on discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/742569353878437978/824731187724681289)
    
    With const generics, it is now possible to write generic iterator over multiple entities at once.
    
    This enables patterns of query iterations like
    
    ```rust
    for [e1, e2, e3] in query.iter_combinations() {
       // do something with relation of all three entities
    }
    ```
    
    The compiler is able to infer the correct iterator for given size of array, so either of those work
    ```rust
    for [e1, e2] in query.iter_combinations()  { ... }
    for [e1, e2, e3] in query.iter_combinations()  { ... }
    ```
    
    This feature can be very useful for systems like collision detection.
    
    When you ask for permutations of size K of N entities:
    - if K == N, you get one result of all entities
    - if K < N, you get all possible subsets of N with size K, without repetition
    - if K > N, the result set is empty (no permutation of size K exist)

    enable cargo deny (#2101)
    
    https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny
    cargo-deny is a tool that can issue errors for dependency issues, among other:
    * security issues in a crate
    * duplicated dependencies with different versions
    * unauthorised license
    
    Added cargo-deny with an opinionated configuration:
    * No middle ground with warnings, either allow or deny
    * Not added to Bors, we probably don't want to block a PR on something that may happen from outside
    * Different github workflow than CI to run only when Cargo.toml files are changed, or on a schedule
    * Each check in its own job to help readability
    * Initial config makes Bevy pass all check
    
    Pushing a first commit with commented config to show errors

    Fix PBR regression for unlit materials  (#2197)
    
    Fixes the frag shader for unlit materials by correcting the scope of the `#ifndef` to include the light functions. Closes #2190, introduced in #2112.
    
    Tested by changing materials in the the `3d_scene` example to be unlit. Unsure how to prevent future regressions without creating a test case scene that will catch these runtime panics.

    use bytemuck crate instead of Byteable trait (#2183)
    
    This gets rid of multiple unsafe blocks that we had to maintain ourselves, and instead depends on library that's commonly used and supported by the ecosystem. We also get support for glam types for free.
    
    There is still some things to clear up with the `Bytes` trait, but that is a bit more substantial change and can be done separately. Also there are already separate efforts to use `crevice` crate, so I've just added that as a TODO.

    Add exit_on_esc_system to examples with window (#2121)
    
    This covers issue #2110
    
    It adds the line `.add_system(bevy::input::system::exit_on_esc_system.system())` before `.run()`
    to every example that uses a window, so users have a quick way to close the examples.
    
    I used the full name `bevy::input::system::exit_on_esc_system`, I thought it gave clarity about being a built-in system.
    
    The examples excluded from the change are the ones in the android, ios, wasm folders, the headless
    examples and the ecs/system_sets example because it closes itself.

    [bevy_ecs] Cleanup SparseSetIndex impls (#2099)
    
    Problem:
    - SparseSetIndex trait implementations had a lot of duplicated code.
    
    Solution:
    - Utilize a macro to implement the trait for a generic type.

    Fixes incorrect `PipelineCompiler::compile_pipeline()` step_mode (#2126)
    
    There's what might be considered a proper bug in `PipelineCompiler::compile_pipeline()`, where it overwrites the `step_mode` for the passed in `VertexBufferLayout` with `InputStepMode::Vertex`. Due to this some ugly workarounds are needed to do any kind of instancing.
    
    In the somewhat longer term, `PipelineCompiler::compile_pipeline()` should probably also handle a `Vec<VertexBufferLayout>`, but that would be a (slightly) larger PR, rather than a bugfix. And I'd love to have this fix in sooner than we can deal with a bigger PR.

    [bevy_derive] Refactor modules for better error message. (#2059)
    
    Problem:
    - When using the 'as_crate' attribute, if 'as_crate' was empty, the only
      error you would get is 'integer underflow'.
    
    Solution:
    - Provide an explicit check for the 'as_crate' attribute's token stream
      to ensure the formatting is correct.
    
    Note:
    - Also reworked 'get_meta' by not making it call 'Manifest::find' twice.

    * plugins example had to be commented out, as adding bevy_internal (where plugins reside) would pull in too many dependencies

    * 3d examples work fine after enabling feature `wgpu/cross`
    
    
    Feature `wgpu/cross` seems to be needed only on some platforms, not sure how to know which. It was introduced in https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/pull/826

    Replace derive(Default) with impl in AssetCountDiagnosticsPlugin (#2077)
    
    Hi, ran into this problem with the derive macro.
    
    It fails trying to derive the Default trait when the asset does not implements it also. This is unnecessary because this plugin does not need that from the asset type, just needs to create the phantom data.

    Bevy derives handling generics in impl definitions. (#2044)
    
    Fixes #2037 (and then some)
    
    Problem:
    - `TypeUuid`, `RenderResource`, and `Bytes` derive macros did not properly handle generic structs.
    
    Solution:
    - Rework the derive macro implementations to handle the generics.

    gltf: load textures asynchronously using io task pool (#1767)
    
    While trying to reduce load time of gltf files, I noticed most of the loading time is spent transforming bytes into an actual texture.
    
    This PR add asynchronously loading for them using io task pool in gltf loader. It reduces loading of a large glb file from 15 seconds to 6~8 on my laptop
    
    To allow asynchronous tasks in an asset loader, I added a reference to the task pool from the asset server in the load context, which I can use later in the loader.

    Adds an alias mouse position -> cursor position (#2038)
    
    This alias is to aid people finding the cursor_position function, as the mouse
    pressed / moved functionality and naming likely primes people for thinking
    of "mouse" before "cursor" when searching the api documentation.

    Adding `WorldQuery` for `WithBundle` (#2024)
    
    In response to #2023, here is a draft for a PR.
    
    Fixes #2023
    
    I've added an example to show how to use `WithBundle`, and also to test it out.
    
    Right now there is a bug: If a bundle and a query are "the same", then it doesn't filter out
    what it needs to filter out.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Print component initated from bundle.
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:57] x = Dummy( <========= This should not get printed
        111,
    )
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:57] x = Dummy(
        222,
    )
    Show all components
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:50] x = Dummy(
        111,
    )
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:50] x = Dummy(
        222,
    )
    ```
    
    However, it behaves the right way, if I add one more component to the bundle,
    so the query and the bundle doesn't look the same:
    
    ```
    Print component initated from bundle.
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:57] x = Dummy(
        222,
    )
    Show all components
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:50] x = Dummy(
        111,
    )
    [examples/ecs/query_bundle.rs:50] x = Dummy(
        222,
    )
    ```
    
    I hope this helps. I'm definitely up for tinkering with this, and adding anything that I'm asked to add
    or change.

    Make Command's public? (#2034)
    
    I'm using Bevy ECS in a project of mine and I'd like to do world changes asynchronously.
    
    The current public API for creating entities, `Commands` , has a lifetime that restricts it from being sent across threads. `CommandQueue` on the other hand is a Vec of commands that can be later ran on a World.
    
    So far this is all public, but the commands themselves are private API. I know the intented use is with `Commands`, but that's not possible for my use case as I mentioned, and so I simply copied over the code for the commands I need and it works. Obviously, this isn't a nice solution, so I'd like to ask if it's not out of scope to make the commands public?

    Fix mesh with no vertex attributes causing panic (#2036)
    
    If a mesh without any vertex attributes is rendered (for example, one that only has indices), bevy will crash since the mesh still creates a vertex buffer even though it's empty. Later code assumes that there is vertex data, causing an index-out-of-bounds panic. This PR fixes the issue by adding a check that there is any vertex data before creating a vertex buffer.
    
    I ran into this issue while rendering a tilemap without any vertex attributes (only indices).
    
    Stack trace:
    ```

    Monomorphize various things (#1914)
    
    Based on #1910
    
    This shrinks breakout from 310k to 293k. Most of the win is in outlining the drop glue of `App`. The other two commits save about 800 bytes total when using two empty systems and two simple resources.
    
    After this PR the full disassembly for
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        App::build().run();
    }
    ```
    
    is about as minimal as it gets, so pretty much all other costs scale linear in the amount of resources, systems, etc.

    * add spans by default for every system executed
    * create folder if missing for feature `wgpu_trace`

    fix dead intra links in doc on `Input` and `Reflect` (#2007)
    
    fix a few dead links
    
    * Links in `Input` missed a refactor
    * `Reflect::downcast` can't use the intra doc link format, as it's not a link to a trait function, but to a function implemented on `dyn Reflect`

    support assets of any size (#1997)
    
    Fixes #1892
    
    The following code is a cut down version of the issue, and crashes the same way:
    ```rust
    enum AssetLifecycleEvent <T> {
        Create(T),
        Free
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let (sender, _receiver) = crossbeam_channel::unbounded();
        sender.send(AssetLifecycleEvent::<[u32; 32000]>::Free).unwrap();
    }
    ```
    
    - We're creating a channel that need to be able to hold `AssetLifecycleEvent::Create(T)` which has the size of our type `T`
    - The two variants of the enums have a very different size
    
    By keeping `T` boxed while sending through the channel, it doesn't crash

    Add system sets and run criteria example (#1909)
    
    If accepted, fixes #1694 .
    
    I wanted to explore system sets and run criteria a bit, so made an example expanding a bit on the snippets shown in the 0.5 release post.
    
    Shows a couple of system sets, uses system labels, run criterion, and a use of the interesting `RunCriterion::pipe` functionality.

    Updated docs for ShouldRun (#1987)
    
    The documentation for `ShouldRun` doesn't completely explain what each of the variants you can return does. For instance, it isn't very clear that looping systems aren't executed again until after all the systems in a stage have had a chance to run.
    
    This PR adds to the documentation for `ShouldRun`, and hopefully clarifies what is happening during a stage's execution when run criteria are checked and systems are being executed.

    Spherical Area Lights (#1901)
    
    I still need to simplify and optimize the code, but here's a preliminary working version of Spherical Area Lights. See the example image below from a modified version of my [cubism-demo-rs](https://github.com/Josh015/cubism-demo-rs) app, which you can also clone and run to see them in action.

    EnumVariantMeta derive (#1972)
    
    There are cases where we want an enum variant name. Right now the only way to do that with rust's std is to derive Debug, but this will also print out the variant's fields. This creates the unfortunate situation where we need to manually write out each variant's string name (ex: in #1963), which is both boilerplate-ey and error-prone. Crates such as `strum` exist for this reason, but it includes a lot of code and complexity that we don't need.
    
    This adds a dead-simple `EnumVariantMeta` derive that exposes `enum_variant_index` and `enum_variant_name` functions. This allows us to make cases like #1963 much cleaner (see the second commit). We might also be able to reuse this logic for `bevy_reflect` enum derives.

    [bevy_core/bytes] Fix UB with accessing memory with incorrect alignment (#1966)
    
    After running `bevy_core` through `miri`, errors were reported surrounding incorrect memory accesses within the `bytes` test suit.
    
    Specifically:
    ```
    test bytes::tests::test_array_round_trip ... error: Undefined Behavior: accessing memory with alignment 1, but alignment 4 is required
       --> crates/bevy_core/src/bytes.rs:55:13

        |             ^^^^^^ accessing memory with alignment 1, but alignment 4 is required
        |
    ```
    
    and
    
    ```
    test bytes::tests::test_vec_bytes_round_trip ... error: Undefined Behavior: accessing memory with alignment 2, but alignment 4 is required
       --> /home/nward/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/core/src/slice/raw.rs:95:14

        |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ accessing memory with alignment 2, but alignment 4 is required
        |
    ```
    
    Solution:
    
    The solution is to use `slice::align_to` method to ensure correct alignment.

    Just to avoid confusion to close readers of the example, this fix ensures cake is transformed to the height at the cake's cell, rather than the height at the player's cell.
    
    Without this, cake may be floating or buried, depending on where the player is standing at time of spawning.

    We discussed with @alice-i-cecile privately on iterators and agreed that making a custom ordered iterator over query makes no sense since materialization is required anyway and it's better to reuse existing components or code. Therefore, just adding an example to the documentation as requested.

    fix memory size for PointLightBundle (#1940)
    
    Introduced in #1778, not fixed by #1931
    
    The size of `Lights` buffer currently is :
    ```rust
        16 // (color, `[f32; 4]`)
        + 16 // (number of lights, `f32` encoded as a `[f32; 4]`)
        + 10 // (maximum number of lights)
            * ( 16 // (light position, `[f32; 4]`
              + 16 // (color, `[16; 4]`)
              + 4 // (inverse_range_squared, `f32`)
              )
    
    -> 392
    ```
    
    This makes the pbr shader crash when running with Xcode debugger or with the WebGL2 backend. They both expect a buffer sized 512. This can also be seen on desktop by adding a second light to a scene with a color, it's position and color will be wrong.
    
    adding a second light to example `load_gltf`:
    ```rust
        commands
            .spawn_bundle(PointLightBundle {
                transform: Transform::from_xyz(-3.0, 5.0, -3.0),
                point_light: PointLight {
                    color: Color::BLUE,
                    ..Default::default()
                },
                ..Default::default()
            })
            .insert(Rotates);
    ```

    Fix the left/right movement direction in state example. (#1879)
    
    Direction of movement was reversed, previously.
    
    (i.e. Left arrow key moved sprite to the right; Right arrow key moved sprite to the left.)
    
    This PR changes the code to now be consistent with, for example, the breakout example: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/81b53d15d4e038261182b8d7c8f65f9a3641fd2d/examples/game/breakout.rs#L184-L190
    
    i.e. AFAICT it's not an issue with the keycode being different/wrong.

    Also, replaced the mention of "fast" compiles, with generic instructions about how to install clang; this is because on my test system, clang didn't make any difference, and it's likely not to do any in general, as it is a relatively small part of the build.

    From suggestion from Godot workflows: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1730#issuecomment-810321110
    
    * Add a feature `bevy_debug` that will make Bevy read a debug config file to setup some debug systems
      * Currently, only one that will exit after x frames
      * Could add option to dump screen to image file once that's possible
    * Add a job in CI workflow that will run a few examples using [`swiftshader`](https://github.com/google/swiftshader)
      * This job takes around 13 minutes, so doesn't add to global CI duration
    
    |example|number of frames|duration|

    This allows the `glTF-Embedded` variants in the [sample models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/) to be used.
    The data url format is relatively small, so I didn't include a crate like [docs.rs/data-url](https://docs.rs/data-url/0.1.0/data_url/).
    
    Also fixes the 'Box With Spaces' model as URIs are now percent-decoded.

    Use a sorted Map for vertex buffer attributes (#1796)
    
    The `VertexBufferLayout` returned by `crates\bevy_render\src\mesh\mesh.rs:308` was unstable, because `HashMap.iter()` has a random order. This caused the pipeline_compiler to wrongly consider a specialization to be different (`crates\bevy_render\src\pipeline\pipeline_compiler.rs:123`), causing each mesh changed event to potentially result in a different `PipelineSpecialization`. This in turn caused `Draw` to emit a `set_pipeline` much more often than needed.
    
    This fix shaves off a `BindPipeline` and two `BindDescriptorSets` (for the Camera and for global renderresources) for every mesh after the first that can now use the same specialization, where it didn't before (which was random).
    
    `StableHashMap` was not a good replacement, because it isn't `Clone`, so instead I replaced it with a `BTreeMap` which is OK in this instance, because there shouldn't be many insertions on `Mesh.attributes` after the mesh is created.

    Example on how to draw using custom mesh and shader (#1565)
    
    I was looking into "lower level" rendering and I saw no example on how to do that. Yet, I think it's something relevant to show, so I set up a simple example on how to do that. I hope it's welcome.
    
    I'm not confident about the code and a review is definitely nice to have, especially because there are a few things that are not great.
    Specifically, I think it would be nice to see how to render with a completely custom set of attributes (position and color, in this case), but I couldn't manage to get it working without normals and uv.
    
    It makes sense if bevy Meshes need these two attributes, but I'm not sure about it.

    Change breakout to use fixed timestamp (#1541)
    
    This PR fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1240, where the ball is escaping the playing field at low framerates.  I did this by moving the movement and physics system into a Fixed Timestep system set and changing the movement steps to a constant.  So we lose the example use of delta_time for changing position, but gain a use of FixedTimestep.
    
    If this is accepted https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pull/102 will need to be updated to match.

    make pbr shader std140 compatible (#1798)
    
    In shaders, `vec3` should be avoided for `std140` layout, as they take the size of a `vec4` and won't support manual padding by adding an additional `float`.
    
    This change is needed for 3D to work in WebGL2. With it, I get PBR to render

    allow up to 16 parameters for systems (#1805)
    
    fixes #1772
    
    1st commit: the limit was at 11 as the macro was not using a range including the upper end. I changed that as it feels the purpose of the macro is clearer that way.
    
    2nd commit: as suggested in the `// TODO`, I added a `Config` trait to go to 16 elements tuples. This means that if someone has a custom system parameter with a config that is not a tuple or an `Option`, they will have to implement `Config` for it instead of the standard `Default`.

    CI break: fix syn version (#1787)
    
    This is a temporary fix for the CI (and anyone building for wasm) break until `wgpu` can update
    
    * `syn` released a version that fixed a bug in how they parsed attributes
    * `wasm_bindgen` released a version that uses that fix
    * but we're stuck with old `wasm_bindgen` as `wgpu` uses a fixed version: https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs/blob/c5ee9cd98310aee66fb49bc98f4f65590304e4aa/Cargo.toml#L118
    
    So, to fix this, either we update everyone to latest version of `wasm_bindgen` or we keep using old version of `syn`.
    
    On Bevy side, it should be faster to fix the version of `syn` to one that works.
    
    More details: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/2510 & https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/2508

    Add `insert_children` and `push_children` to EntityMut (#1728)
    
    The only API to add a parent/child relationship between existing entities is through commands, there is no easy way to do it from `World`. Manually inserting the components is not completely possible since `PreviousParent` has no public constructor.
    
    This PR adds two methods to set entities as children of an `EntityMut`: `insert_children` and `push_children`. ~~The API is similar to the one on `Commands`, except that the parent is the `EntityMut`.~~ The API is the same as in #1703.
    However, the `Parent` and `Children` components are defined in `bevy_transform` which depends on `bevy_ecs`, while `EntityMut` is defined in `bevy_ecs`, so the methods are added to the `BuildWorldChildren` trait instead.
    If #1545 is merged this should be fixed too.
    
    I'm aware cart was experimenting with entity hierarchies, but unless it's a coming soon this PR would be useful to have meanwhile.

    Fixed criteria-less systems being re-ran unnecessarily (#1754)
    
    Fixes #1753.
    
    The problem was introduced while reworking the logic around stages' own criteria. Before #1675 they used to be stored and processed inline with the systems' criteria, and systems without criteria used that of their stage. After, criteria-less systems think they should run, always. This PR more or less restores previous behavior; a less cludge solution can wait until after 0.5 - ideally, until stageless.

    Fix sparse insert (#1748)
    
    Removing the checks on this line https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_sprite/src/frustum_culling.rs#L64 and running the "many_sprites" example revealed two corner case bugs in bevy_ecs. The first, a simple and honest missed line introduced in #1471. The other, an insidious monster that has been there since the ECS v2 rewrite, just waiting for the time to strike:
    
    1. #1471 accidentally removed the "insert" line for sparse set components with the "mutated" bundle state. Re-adding it fixes the problem. I did a slight refactor here to make the implementation simpler and remove a branch.
    2. The other issue is nastier. ECS v2 added an "archetype graph". When determining what components were added/mutated during an archetype change, we read the FromBundle edge (which encodes this state) on the "new" archetype.  The problem is that unlike "add edges" which are guaranteed to be unique for a given ("graph node", "bundle id") pair, FromBundle edges are not necessarily unique:
    
    ```rust
    // OLD_ARCHETYPE -> NEW_ARCHETYPE
    
    // [] -> [usize]
    e.insert(2usize);
    // [usize] -> [usize, i32]
    e.insert(1i32);
    // [usize, i32] -> [usize, i32]
    e.insert(1i32);
    // [usize, i32] -> [usize]
    e.remove::<i32>();
    // [usize] -> [usize, i32]
    e.insert(1i32);
    ```
    
    Note that the second `e.insert(1i32)` command has a different "archetype graph edge" than the first, but they both lead to the same "new archetype".
    
    The fix here is simple: just remove FromBundle edges because they are broken and store the information in the "add edges", which are guaranteed to be unique.
    
    FromBundle edges were added to cut down on the number of archetype accesses / make the archetype access patterns nicer. But benching this change resulted in no significant perf changes and the addition of get_2_mut() for archetypes resolves the access pattern issue.

    In the current impl, next clears out the entire stack and replaces it with a new state. This PR moves this functionality into a replace method, and changes the behavior of next to only change the top state.

    Frustum Culling (for Sprites) (#1492)
    
    This PR adds two systems to the sprite module that culls Sprites and AtlasSprites that are not within the camera's view.
    This is achieved by removing / adding a new  `Viewable` Component dynamically.
    
    Some of the render queries now use a `With<Viewable>` filter to only process the sprites that are actually on screen, which improves performance drastically for scene swith a large amount of sprites off-screen.
    
    https://streamable.com/vvzh2u
    
    This scene shows a map with a 320x320 tiles, with a grid size of 64p.
    This is exactly 102400 Sprites in the entire scene.
    
    Without this PR, this scene runs with 1 to 4 FPS.
    
    With this PR..
    .. at 720p, there are around 600 visible sprites and runs at ~215 FPS
    .. at 1440p there are around 2000 visible sprites and runs at ~135 FPS
    
    The Systems this PR adds take around 1.2ms (with 100K+ sprites in the scene)
    
    Note:
    This is only implemented for Sprites and AtlasTextureSprites.
    There is no culling for 3D in this PR.

    System sets and run criteria v2 (#1675)
    
    I'm opening this prematurely; consider this an RFC that predates RFCs and therefore not super-RFC-like.
    
    This PR does two "big" things: decouple run criteria from system sets, reimagine system sets as weapons of mass system description.
    
    ### What it lets us do:
    
    * Reuse run criteria within a stage.
    * Pipe output of one run criteria as input to another.
    * Assign labels, dependencies, run criteria, and ambiguity sets to many systems at the same time.
    
    ### Things already done:
    * Decoupled run criteria from system sets.
    * Mass system description superpowers to `SystemSet`.
    * Implemented `RunCriteriaDescriptor`.
    * Removed `VirtualSystemSet`.
    * Centralized all run criteria of `SystemStage`.
    * Extended system descriptors with per-system run criteria.
    * `.before()` and `.after()` for run criteria.
    * Explicit order between state driver and related run criteria. Fixes #1672.
    * Opt-in run criteria deduplication; default behavior is to panic.
    * Labels (not exposed) for state run criteria; state run criteria are deduplicated.
    
    ### API issues that need discussion:
    
    * [`FixedTimestep::step(1.0).label("my label")`](https://github.com/Ratysz/bevy/blob/eaccf857cdaeb5a5632b6e75feab5c1ad6267d1d/crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/run_criteria.rs#L120-L122) and [`FixedTimestep::step(1.0).with_label("my label")`](https://github.com/Ratysz/bevy/blob/eaccf857cdaeb5a5632b6e75feab5c1ad6267d1d/crates/bevy_core/src/time/fixed_timestep.rs#L86-L89) are both valid but do very different things.
    
    ---
    
    I will try to maintain this post up-to-date as things change. Do check the diffs in "edited" thingy from time to time.

    Fixes #1736
    
    There seemed to be an obvious transcription error where `setup_pipeline` was being called during `on_update` of `AppState::CreateWindow` instead of `AppState::Setup`.
    
    However, the example still panicked after fixing that.
    
    I'm not sure if there's some intended or unintended change in event processing during state transitions or something, but this PR make the example work again.

    Make Commands and World apis consistent (#1703)
    
    Resolves #1253 #1562
    
    This makes the Commands apis consistent with World apis. This moves to a "type state" pattern (like World) where the "current entity" is stored in an `EntityCommands` builder.
    
    In general this tends to cuts down on indentation and line count. It comes at the cost of needing to type `commands` more and adding more semicolons to terminate expressions.
    
    I also added `spawn_bundle` to Commands because this is a common enough operation that I think its worth providing a shorthand.

    Flexible camera bindings (#1689)
    
    Alternative to #1203 and #1611
    
    Camera bindings have historically been "hacked in". They were _required_ in all shaders and only supported a single Mat4. PBR (#1554) requires the CameraView matrix, but adding this using the "hacked" method forced users to either include all possible camera data in a single binding (#1203) or include all possible bindings (#1611).
    
    This approach instead assigns each "active camera" its own RenderResourceBindings, which are populated by CameraNode. The PassNode then retrieves (and initializes) the relevant bind groups for all render pipelines used by visible entities.
    
    * Enables any number of camera bindings , including zero (with any set or binding number ... set 0 should still be used to avoid rebinds).
    * Renames Camera binding to CameraViewProj
    * Adds CameraView binding

    Reliable change detection (#1471)
    
    # Problem Definition
    
    The current change tracking (via flags for both components and resources) fails to detect changes made by systems that are scheduled to run earlier in the frame than they are.
    
    This issue is discussed at length in [#68](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/68) and [#54](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/54).
    
    This is very much a draft PR, and contributions are welcome and needed.
    
    # Criteria
    1. Each change is detected at least once, no matter the ordering.
    2. Each change is detected at most once, no matter the ordering.
    3. Changes should be detected the same frame that they are made.
    4. Competitive ergonomics. Ideally does not require opting-in.
    5. Low CPU overhead of computation.
    6. Memory efficient. This must not increase over time, except where the number of entities / resources does.
    7. Changes should not be lost for systems that don't run.
    8. A frame needs to act as a pure function. Given the same set of entities / components it needs to produce the same end state without side-effects.
    
    **Exact** change-tracking proposals satisfy criteria 1 and 2.
    **Conservative** change-tracking proposals satisfy criteria 1 but not 2.
    **Flaky** change tracking proposals satisfy criteria 2 but not 1.
    
    # Code Base Navigation
    
    There are three types of flags:
    - `Added`: A piece of data was added to an entity / `Resources`.
    - `Mutated`: A piece of data was able to be modified, because its `DerefMut` was accessed
    - `Changed`: The bitwise OR of `Added` and `Changed`
    
    The special behavior of `ChangedRes`, with respect to the scheduler is being removed in [#1313](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1313) and does not need to be reproduced.
    
    `ChangedRes` and friends can be found in "bevy_ecs/core/resources/resource_query.rs".
    
    The `Flags` trait for Components can be found in "bevy_ecs/core/query.rs".
    
    `ComponentFlags` are stored in "bevy_ecs/core/archetypes.rs", defined on line 446.
    
    # Proposals
    
    **Proposal 5 was selected for implementation.**
    
    ## Proposal 0: No Change Detection
    
    The baseline, where computations are performed on everything regardless of whether it changed.
    
    **Type:** Conservative
    
    **Pros:**
    - already implemented
    - will never miss events
    - no overhead
    
    **Cons:**
    - tons of repeated work
    - doesn't allow users to avoid repeating work (or monitoring for other changes)
    
    ## Proposal 1: Earlier-This-Tick Change Detection
    
    The current approach as of Bevy 0.4. Flags are set, and then flushed at the end of each frame.
    
    **Type:** Flaky
    
    **Pros:**
    - already implemented
    - simple to understand
    - low memory overhead (2 bits per component)
    - low time overhead (clear every flag once per frame)
    
    **Cons:**
    - misses systems based on ordering
    - systems that don't run every frame miss changes
    - duplicates detection when looping
    - can lead to unresolvable circular dependencies
    
    ## Proposal 2: Two-Tick Change Detection
    
    Flags persist for two frames, using a double-buffer system identical to that used in events.
    
    A change is observed if it is found in either the current frame's list of changes or the previous frame's.
    
    **Type:** Conservative
    
    **Pros:**
    - easy to understand
    - easy to implement
    - low memory overhead (4 bits per component)
    - low time overhead (bit mask and shift every flag once per frame)
    
    **Cons:**
    - can result in a great deal of duplicated work
    - systems that don't run every frame miss changes
    - duplicates detection when looping
    
    ## Proposal 3: Last-Tick Change Detection
    
    Flags persist for two frames, using a double-buffer system identical to that used in events.
    
    A change is observed if it is found in the previous frame's list of changes.
    
    **Type:** Exact
    
    **Pros:**
    - exact
    - easy to understand
    - easy to implement
    - low memory overhead (4 bits per component)
    - low time overhead (bit mask and shift every flag once per frame)
    
    **Cons:**
    - change detection is always delayed, possibly causing painful chained delays
    - systems that don't run every frame miss changes
    - duplicates detection when looping
    
    ## Proposal 4: Flag-Doubling Change Detection
    
    Combine Proposal 2 and Proposal 3. Differentiate between `JustChanged` (current behavior) and `Changed` (Proposal 3).
    
    Pack this data into the flags according to [this implementation proposal](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/68#issuecomment-769174804).
    
    **Type:** Flaky + Exact
    
    **Pros:**
    - allows users to acc
    - easy to implement
    - low memory overhead (4 bits per component)
    - low time overhead (bit mask and shift every flag once per frame)
    
    **Cons:**
    - users must specify the type of change detection required
    - still quite fragile to system ordering effects when using the flaky `JustChanged` form
    - cannot get immediate + exact results
    - systems that don't run every frame miss changes
    - duplicates detection when looping
    
    ## [SELECTED] Proposal 5: Generation-Counter Change Detection
    
    A global counter is increased after each system is run. Each component saves the time of last mutation, and each system saves the time of last execution. Mutation is detected when the component's counter is greater than the system's counter. Discussed [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/68#issuecomment-769174804). How to handle addition detection is unsolved; the current proposal is to use the highest bit of the counter as in proposal 1.
    
    **Type:** Exact (for mutations), flaky (for additions)
    
    **Pros:**
    - low time overhead (set component counter on access, set system counter after execution)
    - robust to systems that don't run every frame
    - robust to systems that loop
    
    **Cons:**
    - moderately complex implementation
    - must be modified as systems are inserted dynamically
    - medium memory overhead (4 bytes per component + system)
    - unsolved addition detection
    
    ## Proposal 6: System-Data Change Detection
    
    For each system, track which system's changes it has seen. This approach is only worth fully designing and implementing if Proposal 5 fails in some way.
    
    **Type:** Exact
    
    **Pros:**
    - exact
    - conceptually simple
    
    **Cons:**
    - requires storing data on each system
    - implementation is complex
    - must be modified as systems are inserted dynamically
    
    ## Proposal 7: Total-Order Change Detection
    
    Discussed [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/68#issuecomment-754326523). This proposal is somewhat complicated by the new scheduler, but I believe it should still be conceptually feasible. This approach is only worth fully designing and implementing if Proposal 5 fails in some way.
    
    **Type:** Exact
    
    **Pros:**
    - exact
    - efficient data storage relative to other exact proposals
    
    **Cons:**
    - requires access to the scheduler
    - complex implementation and difficulty grokking
    - must be modified as systems are inserted dynamically
    
    # Tests
    
    - We will need to verify properties 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8. Priority: 1 > 2 = 3 > 8 > 7
    - Ideally we can use identical user-facing syntax for all proposals, allowing us to re-use the same syntax for each.
    - When writing tests, we need to carefully specify order using explicit dependencies.
    - These tests will need to be duplicated for both components and resources.
    - We need to be sure to handle cases where ambiguous system orders exist.
    
    `changing_system` is always the system that makes the changes, and `detecting_system` always detects the changes.
    
    The component / resource changed will be simple boolean wrapper structs.
    
    ## Basic Added / Mutated / Changed
    
    2 x 3 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - Added vs. Changed vs. Mutated
    - `changing_system` runs before `detecting_system`
    - verify at the end of tick 2
    
    ## At Least Once
    
    2 x 3 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - Added vs. Changed vs. Mutated
    - `changing_system` runs after `detecting_system`
    - verify at the end of tick 2
    
    ## At Most Once
    
    2 x 3 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - Added vs. Changed vs. Mutated
    - `changing_system` runs once before `detecting_system`
    - increment a counter based on the number of changes detected
    - verify at the end of tick 2
    
    ## Fast Detection
    2 x 3 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - Added vs. Changed vs. Mutated
    - `changing_system` runs before `detecting_system`
    - verify at the end of tick 1
    
    ## Ambiguous System Ordering Robustness
    2 x 3 x 2 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - Added vs. Changed vs. Mutated
    - `changing_system` runs [before/after] `detecting_system` in tick 1
    - `changing_system` runs [after/before] `detecting_system` in tick 2
    
    ## System Pausing
    2 x 3 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - Added vs. Changed vs. Mutated
    - `changing_system` runs in tick 1, then is disabled by run criteria
    - `detecting_system` is disabled by run criteria until it is run once during tick 3
    - verify at the end of tick 3
    
    ## Addition Causes Mutation
    
    2 design:
    - Resources vs. Components
    - `adding_system_1` adds a component / resource
    - `adding system_2` adds the same component / resource
    - verify the `Mutated` flag at the end of the tick
    - verify the `Added` flag at the end of the tick
    
    First check tests for: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/333
    Second check tests for: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1443
    
    ## Changes Made By Commands
    
    - `adding_system` runs in Update in tick 1, and sends a command to add a component
    - `detecting_system` runs in Update in tick 1 and 2, after `adding_system`
    - We can't detect the changes in tick 1, since they haven't been processed yet
    - If we were to track these changes as being emitted by `adding_system`, we can't detect the changes in tick 2 either, since `detecting_system` has already run once after `adding_system` :(
    
    # Benchmarks
    
    See: [general advice](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/docs/profiling.md), [Criterion crate](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)
    
    There are several critical parameters to vary:
    1. entity count (1 to 10^9)
    2. fraction of entities that are changed (0% to 100%)
    3. cost to perform work on changed entities, i.e. workload (1 ns to 1s)
    
    1 and 2 should be varied between benchmark runs. 3 can be added on computationally.
    
    We want to measure:
    - memory cost
    - run time
    
    We should collect these measurements across several frames (100?) to reduce bootup effects and accurately measure the mean, variance and drift.
    
    Entity-component change detection is much more important to benchmark than resource change detection, due to the orders of magnitude higher number of pieces of data.
    
    No change detection at all should be included in benchmarks as a second control for cases where missing changes is unacceptable.
    
    ## Graphs
    1. y: performance, x: log_10(entity count), color: proposal, facet: performance metric. Set cost to perform work to 0.
    2. y: run time, x: cost to perform work, color: proposal, facet: fraction changed. Set number of entities to 10^6
    3. y: memory, x: frames, color: proposal
    
    # Conclusions
    1. Is the theoretical categorization of the proposals correct according to our tests?
    2. How does the performance of the proposals compare without any load?
    3. How does the performance of the proposals compare with realistic loads?
    4. At what workload does more exact change tracking become worth the (presumably) higher overhead?
    5. When does adding change-detection to save on work become worthwhile?
    6. Is there enough divergence in performance between the best solutions in each class to ship more than one change-tracking solution?
    
    # Implementation Plan
    
    1. Write a test suite.
    2. Verify that tests fail for existing approach.
    3. Write a benchmark suite.
    4. Get performance numbers for existing approach.
    5. Implement, test and benchmark various solutions using a Git branch per proposal.
    6. Create a draft PR with all solutions and present results to team.
    7. Select a solution and replace existing change detection.

    Derive PartialEq for WindowMode (#1688)
    
    Many a game will provide some sort of video settings where a window mode option is a common inclusion. I ran into problems, however, with [egui's](https://github.com/emilk/egui) `combo_box` that imposes a `PartialEq` necessity. Deriving the trait would fix this problem, and as this does not break any existing API it should be a non-controversial change.

    color spaces and representation (#1572)
    
    `Color` can now be from different color spaces or representation:
    - sRGB
    - linear RGB
    - HSL
    
    This fixes #1193 by allowing the creation of const colors of all types, and writing it to the linear RGB color space for rendering.
    
    I went with an enum after trying with two different types (`Color` and `LinearColor`) to be able to use the different variants in all place where a `Color` is expected.
    
    I also added the HLS representation because:
    - I like it
    - it's useful for some case, see example `contributors`: I can just change the saturation and lightness while keeping the hue of the color
    - I think adding another variant not using `red`, `green`, `blue` makes it clearer there are differences

    GLTF loader: support mipmap filters (#1639)
    
    This removes the `GltfError::UnsupportedMinFilter` error.
    
    I don't think this error should have existed in the first place, because it prevents users from using assets that bevy could totally render (without mipmap support as of yet).
    
    It's much better to load the asset properly and then render it (even if it looks a little ugly), than to refuse to load the asset at all, giving users a confusing error.

    it's a followup of #1550
    
    I think calling explicit methods/values instead of default makes the code easier to read: "what is `Quat::default()`" vs "Oh, it's `Quat::IDENTITY`"
    
    `Transform::identity()` and `GlobalTransform::identity()` can also be consts and I replaced the calls to their `default()` impl with `identity()`

    More details are in the associated issue #1609.
    
    While looking for the source of this issue, I've noticed that the `set` and `set_untracked` methods aren't really DRY:
    https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/68606934e32ab45828c628e1cefd3873273f8708/crates/bevy_asset/src/assets.rs#L76-L85

    Shouldn't `set` call `set_untracked`? Also, given the bug that arose from a misusage of these functions, maybe some refactoring is needed?

    remove unsafe get_unchecked (and mut variant) from Tables and Archetypes (#1614)
    
    Removes `get_unchecked` and `get_unchecked_mut` from `Tables` and `Archetypes` collections in favor of safe Index implementations. This fixes a safety error in `Archetypes::get_id_or_insert()` (which previously relied on TableId being valid to be safe ... the alternative was to make that method unsafe too). It also cuts down on a lot of unsafe and makes the code easier to look at. I'm not sure what changed since the last benchmark, but these numbers are more favorable than my last tests of similar changes. I didn't include the Components collection as those severely killed perf last time I tried. But this does inspire me to try again (just in a separate pr)!
    
    Note that the `simple_insert/bevy_unbatched` benchmark fluctuates a lot on both branches (this was also true for prior versions of bevy). It seems like the allocator has more variance for many small allocations. And `sparse_frag_iter/bevy` operates on such a small scale that 10% fluctuations are common.
    
    Some benches do take a small hit here, but I personally think its worth it.
    
    This also fixes a safety error in Query::for_each_mut, which needed to mutably borrow Query (aaahh!).

    * Adds labels and orderings to systems that need them (uses the new many-to-many labels for InputSystem)
    * Removes the Event, PreEvent, Scene, and Ui stages in favor of First, PreUpdate, and PostUpdate (there is more collapsing potential, such as the Asset stages and _maybe_ removing First, but those have more nuance so they should be handled separately)
    * Ambiguity detection now prints component conflicts
    * Removed broken change filters from flex calculation (which implicitly relied on the z-update system always modifying translation.z). This will require more work to make it behave as expected so i just removed it (and it was already doing this work every frame).

    Adds rustfmt configs to wrap and limit comment width (#1603)
    
    Aims to close https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1594.
    
    These options are unstable and depend on the following PR's:
    
    [wrap_comments](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.4.36&search=#wrap_comments): https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3347
    
    [comment_width](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.4.36&search=#comment_width): https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3349
    
    [normalize_comments](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.4.36&search=#normalize_comments): https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3350
    
    @alice-i-cecile do you think this will solve the issue? When enabled, running the formatter locally should take the configurations into account to format comments. `--check` runs should also be considering them. This should be testable on the `nightly` toolchain.
    
    ~I didn't delve into normalizing `//` vs `/* */` though, should I take a look into that too? [normalize_comments](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.4.36&search=#normalize_comments) seems to be the solution for that but it's also unstable (tracking issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3350). I can also add this configuration (commented out, of course) if it's desirable.~ Added `normalize_comments` option.

    Fixes potential panic when unwrapping touch event on Moved phase (#1591)
    
    Should fix https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1516.
    
    I don't have any devices available to test this tbh but I feel like this was the only spot that could be causing a panic.
    
    @ptircylinder since you posted this issue, could you please try to run the example on this branch and check if you get the same behavior while using your device? Thank you!

    Reflection cleanup (#1536)
    
    This is an effort to provide the correct `#[reflect_value(...)]` attributes where they are needed.
    
    Supersedes #1533 and resolves #1528.
    
    ---
    
    I am working under the following assumptions (thanks to @bjorn3 and @Davier for advice here):
    
    - Any `enum` that derives `Reflect` and one or more of { `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `PartialEq`, `Hash` } needs a `#[reflect_value(...)]` attribute containing the same subset of { `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `PartialEq`, `Hash` } that is present on the derive.
    - Same as above for `struct` and `#[reflect(...)]`, respectively.
    - If a `struct` is used as a component, it should also have `#[reflect(Component)]`
    - All reflected types should be registered in their plugins
    
    I treated the following as components (added `#[reflect(Component)]` if necessary):
    - `bevy_render`
      - `struct RenderLayers`
    - `bevy_transform`
      - `struct GlobalTransform`
      - `struct Parent`
      - `struct Transform`
    - `bevy_ui`
      - `struct Style`
    
    Not treated as components:
    - `bevy_math`
      - `struct Size<T>`
      - `struct Rect<T>`
      - Note: The updates for `Size<T>` and `Rect<T>` in `bevy::math::geometry` required using @Davier's suggestion to add `+ PartialEq` to the trait bound. I then registered the specific types used over in `bevy_ui` such as `Size<Val>`, etc. in `bevy_ui`'s plugin, since `bevy::math` does not contain a plugin.
    - `bevy_render`
      - `struct Color`
      - `struct PipelineSpecialization`
      - `struct ShaderSpecialization`
      - `enum PrimitiveTopology`
      - `enum IndexFormat`
    
    Not Addressed:
    - I am not searching for components in Bevy that are _not_ reflected. So if there are components that are not reflected that should be reflected, that will need to be figured out in another PR.
    - I only added `#[reflect(...)]` or `#[reflect_value(...)]` entries for the set of four traits { `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `PartialEq`, `Hash` } _if they were derived via `#[derive(...)]`_. I did not look for manual trait implementations of the same set of four, nor did I consider any traits outside the four.  Are those other possibilities something that needs to be looked into?

    Many-to-many system labels (#1576)
    
    * Systems can now have more than one label attached to them.
    * System labels no longer have to be unique in the stage.
    
    Code like this is now possible:
    ```rust
    SystemStage::parallel()
        .with_system(system_0.system().label("group one").label("first"))
        .with_system(system_1.system().label("group one").after("first"))
        .with_system(system_2.system().after("group one"))
    ```
    
    I've opted to use only the system name in ambiguity reporting, which previously was only a fallback; this, obviously, is because labels aren't one-to-one with systems anymore. We could allow users to name systems to improve this; we'll then have to think about whether or not we want to allow using the name as a label (this would, effectively, introduce implicit labelling, not all implications of which are clear to me yet wrt many-to-many labels).
    
    Dependency cycle errors are reported using the system names and only the labels that form the cycle, with each system-system "edge" in the cycle represented as one or several labels.
    
    Slightly unrelated: `.before()` and `.after()` with a label not attached to any system no longer crashes, and logs a warning instead. This is necessary to, for example, allow plugins to specify execution order with systems of potentially missing other plugins.

    Reorder Imports in Examples (#1598)
    
    This only affected 2 Examples:
    * `generic_reflection`: For some reason, a `pub use` statement was used. This was removed, and alphabetically ordered.
    * `wireframe`: This example used the `bevy_internal` crate directly. Changed to use `bevy` instead.
    
    All other Example Imports are correct.
    
    One potential subjective change is the `removel_detection` example.
    Unlike all other Examples, it has its (first) explanatory comment before the Imports.

    impl SystemParam for Option<Res<T>> / Option<ResMut<T>> (#1494)
    
    This allows users to write systems that do not panic if a resource does not exist at runtime (such as if it has not been inserted yet).
    
    This is a copy-paste of the impls for `Res` and `ResMut`, with an extra check to see if the resource exists.
    
    There might be a cleaner way to do it than this check. I don't know.

    Add EventWriter (#1575)
    
    This adds a `EventWriter<T>` `SystemParam` that is just a thin wrapper around `ResMut<Events<T>>`. This is primarily to have API symmetry between the reader and writer, and has the added benefit of easily improving the API later with no breaking changes.

    feat: clone indices (#1574)
    
    Super simple and straight forward. I need this for the tilemap because if I need to update all chunk indices, then I can calculate it once and clone it. Of course, for now I'm just returning the Vec itself then wrapping it but would be nice if I didn't have to do that.

    fix flip of contributor bird (#1573)
    
    Since 89217171b49eebba527b575eb0a89df0c3533ac6, some birds in example `contributors` where not colored.
    
    Fix is to use `flip_x` of `Sprite` instead of setting `transform.scale.x` to `-1` as described in #1407.
    
    
    It may be an unintended side effect, as now we can't easily display a colored sprite while changing it's scale from `1` to `-1`, we would have to change it's scale from `1` to `0`, then flip it, then change scale from `0` to `1`.

    Silence annoying rustfmt config warnings (#1508)
    
    Silence those [annoying rustfmt config warnings](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1499/checks?check_run_id=1950282111#step:5:66) that happen because we have unstable rustfmt options in `rustfmt.toml`, but we run it in stable on CI.  Thanks to @Ratysz for [calling it out](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1499#issuecomment-783190586). 😄
    
    The final approach we settled on was to comment out the unstable options in `rustfmt.toml`.  Those who are using `nightly` may  uncomment the unstable options locally if they wish. Once the options stabilize, we can uncomment them again.
    
    We also decided that instead of fixing the alias, we would remove the alias entirely so that we do not introduce a custom `.cargo/config.toml` that would conflict with users' custom version of the same file. This means that instead of using a `cargo ci` alias you should use `cargo run -p ci` or `cargo run --package ci` instead.
    
    <details><summary>Original Approach (abandoned)</summary>
    <p>
    
    _We decided **not** to go this way..._
    
    In my quest to find a portable way to filter out the warnings I switched the library used to execute commands from `xshell` to `duct` (as advised by the `xshell` project itself when you want to do less simple things).  This still uses the "xtask" pattern of using a cargo command alias and a rust project for what would have usually been done with a bash script (on posix), just a different helper library is being used internally.
    
    NOTE 1: Also, thanks to some sleuthing by @DJMcNab we were able to fix the broken cargo alias.  The issue turned out to be that `.cargo/config.toml` was being ignored because of `.gitignore`.
    
    NOTE 2: This is a [known breaking change](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1309#discussion_r564023753) for anyone working on bevy who has their own local `.cargo/config.toml`.

    * `prepare_staging_buffers()` based on actual `buffer_byte_len()`
    * `set_required_staging_buffer_size_to_max()` based on item_size
    
    In the case of render assets, `prepare_staging_buffers()` would only operate over changed assets. If some of the assets didn't change, their size wouldn't be taken into account for the `required_staging_buffer_size`. In some cases, this meant the buffers wouldn't be resized when they should. Now `prepare_staging_buffers()` is called over all assets, which may hit performance but at least gets the size right.
    
    Shortly after `prepare_staging_buffers()`,  `set_required_staging_buffer_size_to_max()` would unconditionally overwrite the previously computed value, even if using `item_size` made no sense. Now it only overwrites the value if bigger.
    
    This can be considered a short term hack, but should prevent a few hard to debug panics.

    ♻️ `Timer` refactor to duration.✨ Add `Stopwatch` struct. (#1151)
    
    This pull request is following the discussion on the issue #1127. Additionally, it integrates the change proposed by #1112.
    
    The list of change of this pull request:
    
    * ✨ Add `Timer::times_finished` method that counts the number of wraps for repeating timers.
    * ♻️ Refactored `Timer`
    * 🐛 Fix a bug where 2 successive calls to `Timer::tick` which makes a repeating timer to finish makes `Timer::just_finished` to return `false` where it should return `true`. Minimal failing example:
    ```rust
    use bevy::prelude::*;
    let mut timer: Timer<()> = Timer::from_seconds(1.0, true);
    timer.tick(1.5);
    assert!(timer.finished());
    assert!(timer.just_finished());
    timer.tick(1.5);
    assert!(timer.finished());
    assert!(timer.just_finished()); // <- This fails where it should not
    ```
    * 📚 Add extensive documentation for Timer with doc examples.
    * ✨ Add a `Stopwatch` struct similar to `Timer` with extensive doc and tests.
    
    Even if the type specialization is not retained for bevy, the doc, bugfix and added method are worth salvaging 😅.
    This is my first PR for bevy, please be kind to me ❤️ .

    add Or back to prelude (#1564)
    
    The bevy ecs v2 rewrite seems to have removed the `Or` query filter from the prelude, which I assume was done on accident, since `With` and `Without` are still there.

    Bevy ECS V2 (#1525)
    
    # Bevy ECS V2
    
    This is a rewrite of Bevy ECS (basically everything but the new executor/schedule, which are already awesome). The overall goal was to improve the performance and versatility of Bevy ECS. Here is a quick bulleted list of changes before we dive into the details:
    
    * Complete World rewrite
    * Multiple component storage types:
        * Tables: fast cache friendly iteration, slower add/removes (previously called Archetypes)
        * Sparse Sets: fast add/remove, slower iteration
    * Stateful Queries (caches query results for faster iteration. fragmented iteration is _fast_ now)
    * Stateful System Params (caches expensive operations. inspired by @DJMcNab's work in #1364)
    * Configurable System Params (users can set configuration when they construct their systems. once again inspired by @DJMcNab's work)
    * Archetypes are now "just metadata", component storage is separate
    * Archetype Graph (for faster archetype changes)
    * Component Metadata
        * Configure component storage type
        * Retrieve information about component size/type/name/layout/send-ness/etc
        * Components are uniquely identified by a densely packed ComponentId
        * TypeIds are now totally optional (which should make implementing scripting easier)
    * Super fast "for_each" query iterators
    * Merged Resources into World. Resources are now just a special type of component
    * EntityRef/EntityMut builder apis (more efficient and more ergonomic)
    * Fast bitset-backed `Access<T>` replaces old hashmap-based approach everywhere
    * Query conflicts are determined by component access instead of archetype component access (to avoid random failures at runtime)
        * With/Without are still taken into account for conflicts, so this should still be comfy to use
    * Much simpler `IntoSystem` impl
    * Significantly reduced the amount of hashing throughout the ecs in favor of Sparse Sets (indexed by densely packed ArchetypeId, ComponentId, BundleId, and TableId)
    * Safety Improvements
        * Entity reservation uses a normal world reference instead of unsafe transmute
        * QuerySets no longer transmute lifetimes
        * Made traits "unsafe" where relevant
        * More thorough safety docs
    * WorldCell
        * Exposes safe mutable access to multiple resources at a time in a World
    * Replaced "catch all" `System::update_archetypes(world: &World)` with `System::new_archetype(archetype: &Archetype)`
    * Simpler Bundle implementation
    * Replaced slow "remove_bundle_one_by_one" used as fallback for Commands::remove_bundle with fast "remove_bundle_intersection"
    * Removed `Mut<T>` query impl. it is better to only support one way: `&mut T`
    * Removed with() from `Flags<T>` in favor of `Option<Flags<T>>`, which allows querying for flags to be "filtered" by default
    * Components now have is_send property (currently only resources support non-send)
    * More granular module organization
    * New `RemovedComponents<T>` SystemParam that replaces `query.removed::<T>()`
    * `world.resource_scope()` for mutable access to resources and world at the same time
    * WorldQuery and QueryFilter traits unified. FilterFetch trait added to enable "short circuit" filtering. Auto impled for cases that don't need it
    * Significantly slimmed down SystemState in favor of individual SystemParam state
    * System Commands changed from `commands: &mut Commands` back to `mut commands: Commands` (to allow Commands to have a World reference)
    
    Fixes #1320
    
    ## `World` Rewrite
    
    This is a from-scratch rewrite of `World` that fills the niche that `hecs` used to. Yes, this means Bevy ECS is no longer a "fork" of hecs. We're going out our own!
    
    (the only shared code between the projects is the entity id allocator, which is already basically ideal)
    
    A huge shout out to @SanderMertens (author of [flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs)) for sharing some great ideas with me (specifically hybrid ecs storage and archetype graphs). He also helped advise on a number of implementation details.
    
    ## Component Storage (The Problem)
    
    Two ECS storage paradigms have gained a lot of traction over the years:
    
    * **Archetypal ECS**:
        * Stores components in "tables" with static schemas. Each "column" stores components of a given type. Each "row" is an entity.
        * Each "archetype" has its own table. Adding/removing an entity's component changes the archetype.
        * Enables super-fast Query iteration due to its cache-friendly data layout
        * Comes at the cost of more expensive add/remove operations for an Entity's components, because all components need to be copied to the new archetype's "table"
    * **Sparse Set ECS**:
        * Stores components of the same type in densely packed arrays, which are sparsely indexed by densely packed unsigned integers (Entity ids)
        * Query iteration is slower than Archetypal ECS because each entity's component could be at any position in the sparse set. This "random access" pattern isn't cache friendly. Additionally, there is an extra layer of indirection because you must first map the entity id to an index in the component array.
        * Adding/removing components is a cheap, constant time operation
    
    Bevy ECS V1, hecs, legion, flec, and Unity DOTS are all "archetypal ecs-es". I personally think "archetypal" storage is a good default for game engines. An entity's archetype doesn't need to change frequently in general, and it creates "fast by default" query iteration (which is a much more common operation). It is also "self optimizing". Users don't need to think about optimizing component layouts for iteration performance. It "just works" without any extra boilerplate.
    
    Shipyard and EnTT are "sparse set ecs-es". They employ "packing" as a way to work around the "suboptimal by default" iteration performance for specific sets of components. This helps, but I didn't think this was a good choice for a general purpose engine like Bevy because:
    
    1. "packs" conflict with each other. If bevy decides to internally pack the Transform and GlobalTransform components, users are then blocked if they want to pack some custom component with Transform.
    2. users need to take manual action to optimize
    
    Developers selecting an ECS framework are stuck with a hard choice. Select an "archetypal" framework with "fast iteration everywhere" but without the ability to cheaply add/remove components, or select a "sparse set" framework to cheaply add/remove components but with slower iteration performance.
    
    ## Hybrid Component Storage (The Solution)
    
    In Bevy ECS V2, we get to have our cake and eat it too. It now has _both_ of the component storage types above (and more can be added later if needed):
    
    * **Tables** (aka "archetypal" storage)
        * The default storage. If you don't configure anything, this is what you get
        * Fast iteration by default
        * Slower add/remove operations
    * **Sparse Sets**
        * Opt-in
        * Slower iteration
        * Faster add/remove operations
    
    These storage types complement each other perfectly. By default Query iteration is fast. If developers know that they want to add/remove a component at high frequencies, they can set the storage to "sparse set":
    
    ```rust
    world.register_component(
        ComponentDescriptor::new::<MyComponent>(StorageType::SparseSet)
    ).unwrap();
    ```
    
    ## Archetypes
    
    Archetypes are now "just metadata" ... they no longer store components directly. They do store:
    
    * The `ComponentId`s of each of the Archetype's components (and that component's storage type)
        * Archetypes are uniquely defined by their component layouts
        * For example: entities with "table" components `[A, B, C]` _and_ "sparse set" components `[D, E]` will always be in the same archetype.
    * The `TableId` associated with the archetype
        * For now each archetype has exactly one table (which can have no components),
        * There is a 1->Many relationship from Tables->Archetypes. A given table could have any number of archetype components stored in it:
            * Ex: an entity with "table storage" components `[A, B, C]` and "sparse set" components `[D, E]` will share the same `[A, B, C]` table as an entity with `[A, B, C]` table component and `[F]` sparse set components.
            * This 1->Many relationship is how we preserve fast "cache friendly" iteration performance when possible (more on this later)
    * A list of entities that are in the archetype and the row id of the table they are in
    * ArchetypeComponentIds
        * unique densely packed identifiers for (ArchetypeId, ComponentId) pairs
        * used by the schedule executor for cheap system access control
    * "Archetype Graph Edges" (see the next section)
    
    ## The "Archetype Graph"
    
    Archetype changes in Bevy (and a number of other archetypal ecs-es) have historically been expensive to compute. First, you need to allocate a new vector of the entity's current component ids, add or remove components based on the operation performed, sort it (to ensure it is order-independent), then hash it to find the archetype (if it exists). And thats all before we get to the _already_ expensive full copy of all components to the new table storage.
    
    The solution is to build a "graph" of archetypes to cache these results. @SanderMertens first exposed me to the idea (and he got it from @gjroelofs, who came up with it). They propose adding directed edges between archetypes for add/remove component operations. If `ComponentId`s are densely packed, you can use sparse sets to cheaply jump between archetypes.
    
    Bevy takes this one step further by using add/remove `Bundle` edges instead of `Component` edges. Bevy encourages the use of `Bundles` to group add/remove operations. This is largely for "clearer game logic" reasons, but it also helps cut down on the number of archetype changes required. `Bundles` now also have densely-packed `BundleId`s. This allows us to use a _single_ edge for each bundle operation (rather than needing to traverse N edges ... one for each component). Single component operations are also bundles, so this is strictly an improvement over a "component only" graph.
    
    As a result, an operation that used to be _heavy_ (both for allocations and compute) is now two dirt-cheap array lookups and zero allocations.
    
    ## Stateful Queries
    
    World queries are now stateful. This allows us to:
    
    1. Cache archetype (and table) matches
        * This resolves another issue with (naive) archetypal ECS: query performance getting worse as the number of archetypes goes up (and fragmentation occurs).
    2. Cache Fetch and Filter state
        * The expensive parts of fetch/filter operations (such as hashing the TypeId to find the ComponentId) now only happen once when the Query is first constructed
    3. Incrementally build up state
        * When new archetypes are added, we only process the new archetypes (no need to rebuild state for old archetypes)
    
    As a result, the direct `World` query api now looks like this:
    
    ```rust
    let mut query = world.query::<(&A, &mut B)>();
    for (a, mut b) in query.iter_mut(&mut world) {
    }
    ```
    
    Requiring `World` to generate stateful queries (rather than letting the `QueryState` type be constructed separately) allows us to ensure that _all_ queries are properly initialized (and the relevant world state, such as ComponentIds). This enables QueryState to remove branches from its operations that check for initialization status (and also enables query.iter() to take an immutable world reference because it doesn't need to initialize anything in world).
    
    However in systems, this is a non-breaking change. State management is done internally by the relevant SystemParam.
    
    ## Stateful SystemParams
    
    Like Queries, `SystemParams` now also cache state. For example, `Query` system params store the "stateful query" state mentioned above. Commands store their internal `CommandQueue`. This means you can now safely use as many separate `Commands` parameters in your system as you want. `Local<T>` system params store their `T` value in their state (instead of in Resources).
    
    SystemParam state also enabled a significant slim-down of SystemState. It is much nicer to look at now.
    
    Per-SystemParam state naturally insulates us from an "aliased mut" class of errors we have hit in the past (ex: using multiple `Commands` system params).
    
    (credit goes to @DJMcNab for the initial idea and draft pr here #1364)
    
    ## Configurable SystemParams
    
    @DJMcNab also had the great idea to make SystemParams configurable. This allows users to provide some initial configuration / values for system parameters (when possible). Most SystemParams have no config (the config type is `()`), but the `Local<T>` param now supports user-provided parameters:
    
    ```rust
    
    fn foo(value: Local<usize>) {
    }
    
    app.add_system(foo.system().config(|c| c.0 = Some(10)));
    ```
    
    ## Uber Fast "for_each" Query Iterators
    
    Developers now have the choice to use a fast "for_each" iterator, which yields ~1.5-3x iteration speed improvements for "fragmented iteration", and minor ~1.2x iteration speed improvements for unfragmented iteration.
    
    ```rust
    fn system(query: Query<(&A, &mut B)>) {
        // you now have the option to do this for a speed boost
        query.for_each_mut(|(a, mut b)| {
        });
    
        // however normal iterators are still available
        for (a, mut b) in query.iter_mut() {
        }
    }
    ```
    
    I think in most cases we should continue to encourage "normal" iterators as they are more flexible and more "rust idiomatic". But when that extra "oomf" is needed, it makes sense to use `for_each`.
    
    We should also consider using `for_each` for internal bevy systems to give our users a nice speed boost (but that should be a separate pr).
    
    ## Component Metadata
    
    `World` now has a `Components` collection, which is accessible via `world.components()`. This stores mappings from `ComponentId` to `ComponentInfo`, as well as `TypeId` to `ComponentId` mappings (where relevant). `ComponentInfo` stores information about the component, such as ComponentId, TypeId, memory layout, send-ness (currently limited to resources), and storage type.
    
    ## Significantly Cheaper `Access<T>`
    
    We used to use `TypeAccess<TypeId>` to manage read/write component/archetype-component access. This was expensive because TypeIds must be hashed and compared individually. The parallel executor got around this by "condensing" type ids into bitset-backed access types. This worked, but it had to be re-generated from the `TypeAccess<TypeId>`sources every time archetypes changed.
    
    This pr removes TypeAccess in favor of faster bitset access everywhere. We can do this thanks to the move to densely packed `ComponentId`s and `ArchetypeComponentId`s.
    
    ## Merged Resources into World
    
    Resources had a lot of redundant functionality with Components. They stored typed data, they had access control, they had unique ids, they were queryable via SystemParams, etc. In fact the _only_ major difference between them was that they were unique (and didn't correlate to an entity).
    
    Separate resources also had the downside of requiring a separate set of access controls, which meant the parallel executor needed to compare more bitsets per system and manage more state.
    
    I initially got the "separate resources" idea from `legion`. I think that design was motivated by the fact that it made the direct world query/resource lifetime interactions more manageable. It certainly made our lives easier when using Resources alongside hecs/bevy_ecs. However we already have a construct for safely and ergonomically managing in-world lifetimes: systems (which use `Access<T>` internally).
    
    This pr merges Resources into World:
    
    ```rust
    world.insert_resource(1);
    world.insert_resource(2.0);
    let a = world.get_resource::<i32>().unwrap();
    let mut b = world.get_resource_mut::<f64>().unwrap();
    *b = 3.0;
    ```
    
    Resources are now just a special kind of component. They have their own ComponentIds (and their own resource TypeId->ComponentId scope, so they don't conflict wit components of the same type). They are stored in a special "resource archetype", which stores components inside the archetype using a new `unique_components` sparse set (note that this sparse set could later be used to implement Tags). This allows us to keep the code size small by reusing existing datastructures (namely Column, Archetype, ComponentFlags, and ComponentInfo). This allows us the executor to use a single `Access<ArchetypeComponentId>` per system. It should also make scripting language integration easier.
    
    _But_ this merge did create problems for people directly interacting with `World`. What if you need mutable access to multiple resources at the same time? `world.get_resource_mut()` borrows World mutably!
    
    ## WorldCell
    
    WorldCell applies the `Access<ArchetypeComponentId>` concept to direct world access:
    
    ```rust
    let world_cell = world.cell();
    let a = world_cell.get_resource_mut::<i32>().unwrap();
    let b = world_cell.get_resource_mut::<f64>().unwrap();
    ```
    
    This adds cheap runtime checks (a sparse set lookup of `ArchetypeComponentId` and a counter) to ensure that world accesses do not conflict with each other. Each operation returns a `WorldBorrow<'w, T>` or `WorldBorrowMut<'w, T>` wrapper type, which will release the relevant ArchetypeComponentId resources when dropped.
    
    World caches the access sparse set (and only one cell can exist at a time), so `world.cell()` is a cheap operation.
    
    WorldCell does _not_ use atomic operations. It is non-send, does a mutable borrow of world to prevent other accesses, and uses a simple `Rc<RefCell<ArchetypeComponentAccess>>` wrapper in each WorldBorrow pointer.
    
    The api is currently limited to resource access, but it can and should be extended to queries / entity component access.
    
    ## Resource Scopes
    
    WorldCell does not yet support component queries, and even when it does there are sometimes legitimate reasons to want a mutable world ref _and_ a mutable resource ref (ex: bevy_render and bevy_scene both need this). In these cases we could always drop down to the unsafe `world.get_resource_unchecked_mut()`, but that is not ideal!
    
    Instead developers can use a "resource scope"
    
    ```rust
    world.resource_scope(|world: &mut World, a: &mut A| {
    })
    ```
    
    This temporarily removes the `A` resource from `World`, provides mutable pointers to both, and re-adds A to World when finished. Thanks to the move to ComponentIds/sparse sets, this is a cheap operation.
    
    If multiple resources are required, scopes can be nested. We could also consider adding a "resource tuple" to the api if this pattern becomes common and the boilerplate gets nasty.
    
    ## Query Conflicts Use ComponentId Instead of ArchetypeComponentId
    
    For safety reasons, systems cannot contain queries that conflict with each other without wrapping them in a QuerySet. On bevy `main`, we use ArchetypeComponentIds to determine conflicts. This is nice because it can take into account filters:
    
    ```rust
    // these queries will never conflict due to their filters
    fn filter_system(a: Query<&mut A, With<B>>, b: Query<&mut B, Without<B>>) {
    }
    ```
    
    But it also has a significant downside:
    ```rust
    // these queries will not conflict _until_ an entity with A, B, and C is spawned
    fn maybe_conflicts_system(a: Query<(&mut A, &C)>, b: Query<(&mut A, &B)>) {
    }
    ```
    
    The system above will panic at runtime if an entity with A, B, and C is spawned. This makes it hard to trust that your game logic will run without crashing.
    
    In this pr, I switched to using `ComponentId` instead. This _is_ more constraining. `maybe_conflicts_system` will now always fail, but it will do it consistently at startup. Naively, it would also _disallow_ `filter_system`, which would be a significant downgrade in usability. Bevy has a number of internal systems that rely on disjoint queries and I expect it to be a common pattern in userspace.
    
    To resolve this, I added a new `FilteredAccess<T>` type, which wraps `Access<T>` and adds with/without filters. If two `FilteredAccess` have with/without values that prove they are disjoint, they will no longer conflict.
    
    ## EntityRef / EntityMut
    
    World entity operations on `main` require that the user passes in an `entity` id to each operation:
    
    ```rust
    let entity = world.spawn((A, )); // create a new entity with A
    world.get::<A>(entity);
    world.insert(entity, (B, C));
    world.insert_one(entity, D);
    ```
    
    This means that each operation needs to look up the entity location / verify its validity. The initial spawn operation also requires a Bundle as input. This can be awkward when no components are required (or one component is required).
    
    These operations have been replaced by `EntityRef` and `EntityMut`, which are "builder-style" wrappers around world that provide read and read/write operations on a single, pre-validated entity:
    
    ```rust
    // spawn now takes no inputs and returns an EntityMut
    let entity = world.spawn()
        .insert(A) // insert a single component into the entity
        .insert_bundle((B, C)) // insert a bundle of components into the entity
        .id() // id returns the Entity id
    
    // Returns EntityMut (or panics if the entity does not exist)
    world.entity_mut(entity)
        .insert(D)
        .insert_bundle(SomeBundle::default());
    {
        // returns EntityRef (or panics if the entity does not exist)
        let d = world.entity(entity)
            .get::<D>() // gets the D component
            .unwrap();
        // world.get still exists for ergonomics
        let d = world.get::<D>(entity).unwrap();
    }
    
    // These variants return Options if you want to check existence instead of panicing
    world.get_entity_mut(entity)
        .unwrap()
        .insert(E);
    
    if let Some(entity_ref) = world.get_entity(entity) {
        let d = entity_ref.get::<D>().unwrap();
    }
    ```
    
    This _does not_ affect the current Commands api or terminology. I think that should be a separate conversation as that is a much larger breaking change.
    
    ## Safety Improvements
    
    * Entity reservation in Commands uses a normal world borrow instead of an unsafe transmute
    * QuerySets no longer transmutes lifetimes
    * Made traits "unsafe" when implementing a trait incorrectly could cause unsafety
    * More thorough safety docs
    
    ## RemovedComponents SystemParam
    
    The old approach to querying removed components: `query.removed:<T>()` was confusing because it had no connection to the query itself. I replaced it with the following, which is both clearer and allows us to cache the ComponentId mapping in the SystemParamState:
    
    ```rust
    fn system(removed: RemovedComponents<T>) {
        for entity in removed.iter() {
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Simpler Bundle implementation
    
    Bundles are no longer responsible for sorting (or deduping) TypeInfo. They are just a simple ordered list of component types / data. This makes the implementation smaller and opens the door to an easy "nested bundle" implementation in the future (which i might even add in this pr). Duplicate detection is now done once per bundle type by World the first time a bundle is used.
    
    ## Unified WorldQuery and QueryFilter types
    
    (don't worry they are still separate type _parameters_ in Queries .. this is a non-breaking change)
    
    WorldQuery and QueryFilter were already basically identical apis. With the addition of `FetchState` and more storage-specific fetch methods, the overlap was even clearer (and the redundancy more painful).
    
    QueryFilters are now just `F: WorldQuery where F::Fetch: FilterFetch`. FilterFetch requires `Fetch<Item = bool>` and adds new "short circuit" variants of fetch methods. This enables a filter tuple like `(With<A>, Without<B>, Changed<C>)` to stop evaluating the filter after the first mismatch is encountered. FilterFetch is automatically implemented for `Fetch` implementations that return bool.
    
    This forces fetch implementations that return things like `(bool, bool, bool)` (such as the filter above) to manually implement FilterFetch and decide whether or not to short-circuit.
    
    ## More Granular Modules
    
    World no longer globs all of the internal modules together. It now exports `core`, `system`, and `schedule` separately. I'm also considering exporting `core` submodules directly as that is still pretty "glob-ey" and unorganized (feedback welcome here).
    
    ## Remaining Draft Work (to be done in this pr)
    
    * ~~panic on conflicting WorldQuery fetches (&A, &mut A)~~
        * ~~bevy `main` and hecs both currently allow this, but we should protect against it if possible~~
    * ~~batch_iter / par_iter (currently stubbed out)~~
    * ~~ChangedRes~~
        * ~~I skipped this while we sort out #1313. This pr should be adapted to account for whatever we land on there~~.
    * ~~The `Archetypes` and `Tables` collections use hashes of sorted lists of component ids to uniquely identify each archetype/table. This hash is then used as the key in a HashMap to look up the relevant ArchetypeId or TableId. (which doesn't handle hash collisions properly)~~
    * ~~It is currently unsafe to generate a Query from "World A", then use it on "World B" (despite the api claiming it is safe). We should probably close this gap. This could be done by adding a randomly generated WorldId to each world, then storing that id in each Query. They could then be compared to each other on each `query.do_thing(&world)` operation. This _does_ add an extra branch to each query operation, so I'm open to other suggestions if people have them.~~
    * ~~Nested Bundles (if i find time)~~
    
    ## Potential Future Work
    
    * Expand WorldCell to support queries.
    * Consider not allocating in the empty archetype on `world.spawn()`
        * ex: return something like EntityMutUninit, which turns into EntityMut after an `insert` or `insert_bundle` op
        * this actually regressed performance last time i tried it, but in theory it should be faster
    * Optimize SparseSet::insert (see `PERF` comment on insert)
    * Replace SparseArray `Option<T>` with T::MAX to cut down on branching
        * would enable cheaper get_unchecked() operations
    * upstream fixedbitset optimizations
        * fixedbitset could be allocation free for small block counts (store blocks in a SmallVec)
        * fixedbitset could have a const constructor
    * Consider implementing Tags (archetype-specific by-value data that affects archetype identity)
        * ex: ArchetypeA could have `[A, B, C]` table components and `[D(1)]` "tag" component. ArchetypeB could have `[A, B, C]` table components and a `[D(2)]` tag component. The archetypes are different, despite both having D tags because the value inside D is different.
        * this could potentially build on top of the `archetype.unique_components` added in this pr for resource storage.
    * Consider reverting `all_tuples` proc macro in favor of the old `macro_rules` implementation
        * all_tuples is more flexible and produces cleaner documentation (the macro_rules version produces weird type parameter orders due to parser constraints)
        * but unfortunately all_tuples also appears to make Rust Analyzer sad/slow when working inside of `bevy_ecs` (does not affect user code)
    * Consider "resource queries" and/or "mixed resource and entity component queries" as an alternative to WorldCell
        * this is basically just "systems" so maybe it's not worth it
    * Add more world ops
        * `world.clear()`
        * `world.reserve<T: Bundle>(count: usize)`
     * Try using the old archetype allocation strategy (allocate new memory on resize and copy everything over). I expect this to improve batch insertion performance at the cost of unbatched performance. But thats just a guess. I'm not an allocation perf pro :)
     * Adapt Commands apis for consistency with new World apis
    
    ## Benchmarks
    
    key:
    
    * `bevy_old`: bevy `main` branch
    * `bevy`: this branch
    * `_foreach`: uses an optimized for_each iterator
    * ` _sparse`: uses sparse set storage (if unspecified assume table storage)
    * `_system`: runs inside a system (if unspecified assume test happens via direct world ops)

    Wireframe Rendering Pipeline (#562)
    
    This PR implements wireframe rendering.
    
    Usage:
    
    This is now ready as soon as #1401 gets merged.
    
    
    Usage:
    
    ```rust
        app
            .insert_resource(WgpuOptions {
                name: Some("3d_scene"),
                features: WgpuFeatures::NON_FILL_POLYGON_MODE,
                ..Default::default()
            }) // To enable the NON_FILL_POLYGON_MODE feature
            .add_plugin(WireframePlugin)
            .run();
    
    ```
    
    Now we just need to add the Wireframe component on an entity, and it'll draw. its wireframe.
    
    
    We can also enable wireframe drawing globally by setting the global property in the `WireframeConfig` resource to `true`.

    Glb textures should use bevy_render to load images (#1454)
    
    Fixes #1396

    Issue was that, when loading an image directly from its bytes in the binary glb file, it didn't follow the same flow as when loaded as a texture file. This PR removes the dependency to `image` from `bevy_gltf`, and load the image using `bevy_render` in all cases. I also added support for more mime types while there.

    convert grayscale images to rgb (#1524)
    
    Fixes #1518
    
    Issue was that images loaded as [`ImageLumaA8`](https://docs.rs/image/0.23.13/image/enum.DynamicImage.html#variant.ImageLumaA8) (grayscale with alpha channel) from `image` were considered as [`Rg8Unorm`](https://docs.rs/wgpu/0.7.0/wgpu/enum.TextureFormat.html#variant.Rg8Unorm) (red green channels) from `wgpu`.
    Same for `ImageLuma8` (grayscale) that was converted to `R8Unorm` (only red channel).
    
    As `wgpu` doesn't seem to have grayscale texture formats, I converted the grayscale textures to rgba.

    Add Sprite Flipping (#1407)
    
    OK, here's my attempt at sprite flipping. There are a couple of points that I need review/help on, but I think the UX is about ideal:
    
    ```rust
            .spawn(SpriteBundle {
                material: materials.add(texture_handle.into()),
                sprite: Sprite {
                    // Flip the sprite along the x axis
                    flip: SpriteFlip { x: true, y: false },
                    ..Default::default()
                },
                ..Default::default()
            });
    ```
    
    Now for the issues. The big issue is that for some reason, when flipping the UVs on the sprite, there is a light "bleeding" or whatever you call it where the UV tries to sample past the texture boundry and ends up clipping. This is only noticed when resizing the window, though. You can see a screenshot below.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25393315/107098172-397aaa00-67d4-11eb-8e02-c90c820cd70e.png)
    
    I am quite baffled why the texture sampling is overrunning like it is and could use some guidance if anybody knows what might be wrong.
    
    The other issue, which I just worked around, is that I had to remove the `#[render_resources(from_self)]` annotation from the Spritesheet because the `SpriteFlip` render resource wasn't being picked up properly in the shader when using it. I'm not sure what the cause of that was, but by removing the annotation and re-organizing the shader inputs accordingly the problem was fixed.
    
    I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way to do this or if there is a better way, but I wanted to try it out if only for the learning experience. Let me know what you think!

    In particular, notice that the width of the diagnostics has been significantly reduced - within vscode the value no longer wraps on my 1920 width monitor. The value is still 105 columns wide, so there is room for improvement however.

    Add docs & example for SystemParam (#1435)
    
    It took me a little while to figure out how to use the `SystemParam` derive macro to easily create my own params. So I figured I'd add some docs and an example with what I learned.
    
    - Fixed a bug in the `SystemParam` derive macro where it didn't detect the correct crate name when used in an example (no longer relevant, replaced by #1426 - see further)
    - Added some doc comments and a short example code block in the docs for the `SystemParam` trait
    - Added a more complete example with explanatory comments in examples

    This replaces `ChangedRes` with simple associated methods that return the same info, but don't block execution. Also, since ChangedRes was infectious and was the only reason `FetchSystemParam::get_params` and `System::run_unsafe` returned `Option`s, their implementation could be simplified after this PR is merged, or as part of it with a future commit.

    Xtask CI (#1387)
    
    This PR is easiest to review commit by commit.
    
    Followup on https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/1309#issuecomment-767310084
    
    - [x] Switch from a bash script to an xtask rust workspace member.
      - Results in ~30s longer CI due to compilation of the xtask itself
      - Enables Bevy contributors on any platform to run `cargo ci` to run linting -- if the default available Rust is the same version as on CI, then the command should give an identical result.
    - [x] Use the xtask from official CI so there's only one place to update.
    - [x] Bonus: Run clippy on the _entire_ workspace (existing CI setup was missing the `--workspace` flag
      - [x] Clean up newly-exposed clippy errors
    
    ~#1388 builds on this to clean up newly discovered clippy errors -- I thought it might be nicer as a separate PR.~  Nope, merged it into this one so CI would pass.

    Make vertex buffers optional (#1485)
    
    For some cases, like driving a full screen fragment shader, it is sometimes convenient to not have to create and upload a mesh because the necessary vertices are simple to synthesize in the vertex shader. Bevy's existing pipeline compiler assumes that there will always be a vertex buffer. This PR changes that such that vertex buffer descriptor is only added to the pipeline layout if there are vertex attributes in the shader.

    move texture_to_image and image_to_texture into new module (#1381)
    
    The `Texture::convert` function previously was only compiled when
    one of the image format features (`png`, `jpeg` etc.) were enabled.
    The `bevy_sprite` crate needs this function though, which led
    to compilation errors when using `cargo check --no-default-features
    --features render`.
    
    Now the `convert` function has no features and the `texture_to_image`
    and `image_to_texture` utilites functions are in an unconditionally
    compiled module.

    Faster compilation of bevy_diagnostic (#1235)
    
    * Remove AHashExt
    
    There is little benefit of Hash*::new() over Hash*::default(), but it
    does require more code that needs to be duplicated for every Hash* in
    bevy_utils. It may also slightly increase compile times.
    
    * Add StableHash* to bevy_utils
    
    * Use StableHashMap instead of HashMap + BTreeSet for diagnostics
    
    This is a significant reduction in the release mode compile times of
    bevy_diagnostics
    
    ```

    Use fxhash in TypeIdMap. (#1119)
    
    Relying on TypeId being some hash internally isn't future-proof because there is no guarantee about internal layout or structure of TypeId. I benchmarked TypeId noop hasher vs fxhash and found that there is very little difference.
    Also fxhash is likely to be better supported because it is widely used in rustc itself.

    fix repeated gamepad events (#1221)
    
    Previously, if the actual value of LeftStickX was e.g. 0.034 and fluctuated a little
    bit (less than the threshold) it would repeatedly send out events,
    because it compared the value to the *filtered* old one - 0.0 - which is
    more then `0.01` (the threshold) away.
    
    The is fixed by first doing the deadzone and then comparing to the old
    value.
    Another possible solution would be to store both the actual old value
    and the filtered one, but that would add complexity.

    Text2d render quality (#1171)
    
    improve quality of text2d rendering
    
    * remove coordinate tweaking in sprite-sheet shader
    * fixes glyph shimmering of animated text
    * reposition glyph before passing it to ab_glyph to normalize its rendering
    
    The result of layout of sequence of glyphs causes individuals to have fractional positions, but since glyph renderings are reused for future instances of that glyph, this produces errors. This change accepts the errors but repositions the glyph to "0, 0" in an effort to get the cleanest possible rendering.

    Test entity labels, fixed corner cases, changed interface (#1152)
    
    * Test entity labels, fixed corner cases, changed interface
    
    * add tests for entity_labels_system
    * fixed filling label_entities map
    * fixed corner cases when removing entities, Labels component
    * changed EntityLabels::get to return slice or empty slice instead of
      None or Some empty or non-empty slice
    
    Changing the interface of EntityLabels::get is beneficial, since else
    you would get different results in case there was an entity before that
    with this missing label or not. You would either get None or Some(&[])
    and need to handle both, which is actually not necessary.
    
    * register type Labels in CorePlugin

    Extend the Texture asset type to support 3D data (#903)
    
    Extend the Texture asset type to support 3D data
    
    Textures are still loaded from images as 2D, but they can be reshaped

    Adjust how `ArchetypeAccess` tracks mutable & immutable deps (#660)
    
    `ArchetypeAccess` was tracking `immutable` and `mutable` separately.
    This means that checking is_compatible requires three checks:
    m+m, m+i, i+m.
    
    Instead, continue tracking `mutable` accesses, but instead of
    `immutable` track `immutable | mutable` as another `accessed` bit mask.
    This drops the comparisons to two (m+a, a+m) and turns out to be
    what the rest of the code base wants too, unifying various duplicated
    checks and loops.

    render: Export specific items outside of prelude (#473)
    
    It's a preference of some people to not use prelude modules at all in
    order to make their imports more explicit. Currently, items like
    `Camera3dComponent` are only exported in a prelude module, making an
    explicit import look like
    
    `use bevy::prelude::Camera3dComponent`
    
    which feels a bit hackish. This change doesn't remove such components
    from the prelude, but just re-exports them at the crate's
    (`bevy_render` in this case) root.

    Resource change tracking (#388)
    
    * Add mutated tracker on resources and ChangedRes query for added or mutated resources.
    
    * ResMut:::new() now takes a reference to a 'mutated' flag in its archetype.
    
    * Change FetchResource so that get() returns an Option. Systems using Resources will only be called if all fetched Resources are Some(). This is done to implement ChangedRes, which is Some iff the Resource has been changed.
    
    * Add OrRes for a logical or in tuples of Resource queries.
    
    * Separate resource query get() in is_some() and get() methods for clarity
    
    * Remove unneeded unsafe

    Allow calling winit with the 'run_return' variant of the run function (#243)
    
    This adds a new WinitConfig resource that can be used to configure the behavior of winit.
    When `return_from_run` is set to `true`, `App::run()` will return on `target_os` configurations that
    support it.
    
    Closes bevyengine/bevy#167.

    separate albedo color and make it required
    
    I worked really hard to make ColorSource work, but sadly we need color to be instanceable and making it optional would add too much complexity. Maybe at some point in the future we can add it back. On the plus side, albedo color now modulates the albedo texture

    Reflect Vertex Buffer Attributes
    
    Must follow VertexBufferDescriptorName_AttributeName format
    
    I_VertexBufferDescriptorName_AttributeName indicates that an attribute is instanced
    
    Currently all attributes must be defined in shaders or offsets will be incorrect.
