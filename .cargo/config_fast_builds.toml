# Copy this file to `config.toml` to speed up your builds.
#
# This configuration enables the following:
#
# - Faster linker (stable)
#   - LLD is a faster drop-in replacement for the default linker, part of the LLVM project.
#     It requires installation, please see the relevant section of this config for your platform.
#   - Mold / Sold is a linker faster than even LLD, but with limited platform support.
#     It requires installation, please see the relevant section of this config for your platform.
#     Mold is precompiled for Linux, but must be manually built on MacOS and is unavailable for Windows.
#   - Please note that LLD and Mold are incompatible with one another. Pick one and comment out the other!
# - Nightly (unstable) features
#   - `share-generics` prevents duplicating monomorphized generic code across crates.
#   - `threads` makes use of the parallel frontend to increase compiler performance.

# In most cases the gains are negligible, but if you are on macos and have slow compile times you should see significant gains.
