A long-standing feature request from our users is support for text input. Whether the user is creating a new character, logging in with a username and password, or creating a new save file, it's vitally important for them to be able to enter a string of text. Unfortunately, writing a robust and feature-rich text input widget is not easy, especially one that supports all of the expected capabilities (such as undo, range selection, and scrolling). This effort is made much easier now that Bevy has incorporated the cosmic crate for text handling.

Features:
* Placeholder text for empty inputs
* Password mode.
* Filters applied at edit.
* Autopropagated events emitted on submission, invalid edits and text changes.
* Input method agnostic, users queue `TextEdit`s to make changes to the text input's buffer.
* Max character limit
* Responsive height sizing.
* Vertical and horizontal scrolling
* Fixes the line cropping while vertical scrolling bug in cosmic-text.
* Full undo and redo.
* Text selection.
* Cut, copy and paste.
* Numeric input modes.
* Single line modes.
* Support for the common navigation actions like home, end, page down, page up, next word, end of paragraph, etc.
* Backspace.
* Overwrite mode.
* Click to place cursor.
* Drag to select.
* Double click to select a word.
* Triple click to set select a line.
* Indent and unident.
* A `TextInputValue` component that contains a copy of the buffer's text and is automatically synchronized on edits. On insertion the `TextInputValue`s contents replace the current text in the `TextInputBuffer`.
* Support for bidirectional text, including RTL scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew.

What we are releasing in this milestone is only the lowest-level, foundational elements of text editing. These are not complete, self-contained widgets, which will come in the next milestone, but more like a toolkit with "some assembly required". For now, you can write your own text input widgets, following the provided examples as a guide.
