Bevy now supports downloading assets from the web over http and https.
Use the new `http` and `https` features to enable `http://` and `https://` URLs as asset paths.
This functionality is powered by the [`ureq`](https://github.com/algesten/ureq) crate on native platforms and the fetch API on wasm.

```rust
let image = asset_server.load("https://example.com/image.png");
commands.spawn(Sprite::from_image(image));
```

By default these assets arenâ€™t saved anywhere but you can enable the `web_asset_cache` feature to cache assets on your file system.

You must add rules to determine which web assets may be loaded by setting `path_is_allowed` field on `WebAssetPlugin`:

```rust
App::new()
    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(WebAssetPlugin {
         path_is_allowed: |url| url.starts_with("https://example.com/")
    })))
```

The implementation has changed quite a bit but this feature originally started out as an upstreaming of the [`bevy_web_asset`](https://github.com/johanhelsing/bevy_web_asset) crate.
Special thanks to @johanhelsing and bevy_web_asset's contributors!
