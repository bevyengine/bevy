(TODO: Embed screenshot of atmosphere-generated reflections)

You can now have dynamic reflections and ambient light in your scene that match the procedural sky.

As the sky changes, reflections on shiny and rough materials update automatically to stay consistent â€” no pre-baked environment maps needed.

To enable this for a camera, add the new component `AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight` to the camera entity:

```rust
commands.spawn((
    Camera3d::default(),
    // Generates an environment cubemap from the atmosphere for this view
    AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight::default(),
));
```

Note that this is a per-view effect (per camera). Light probes are not yet supported.

Special thanks to @atlv24, @JMS55 and @ecoskey for reviews and feedback.
