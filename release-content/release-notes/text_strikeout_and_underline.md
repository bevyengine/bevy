`bevy_text` now supports strikethrough and underline. To display text with strikethrough or underline, just add the `Strikethrough` or `Underline` components to any `Text`, `Text2d`, or `TextSpan` entity. You can set colors for strikethrough and underline using the `StrikethroughColor` and `UnderlineColor` components, respectively.
