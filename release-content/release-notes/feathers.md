As part of our commitment to enhance the developer experience for UI creation in Bevy, we are
pleased to introduce "Feathers" - a comprehensive widget set that offers:

- Standard widgets designed to match the look and feel of the planned Bevy Editor
- Components that can be leveraged to build custom editors, inspectors, and utility interfaces
- Essential UI elements including buttons, sliders, checkboxes, menu buttons, and more
- Layout containers for organizing and structuring UI elements
- Decorative elements such as icons for visual enhancement
- Robust theming support ensuring consistent visual styling across applications
- Accessibility features with built-in screen reader and assistive technology support
- Interactive cursor behavior that changes appropriately when hovering over widgets

Feathers aims to provide developers with a polished, accessible, and cohesive toolkit for all UI
development needs within the Bevy ecosystem.
