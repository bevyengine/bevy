`Text2d` is a simple worldspace text API: great for damage numbers and simple labels.
It deserves a few bells and whistles though, so it can keep up with its UI brother, `Text`.

In addition to the new text background color, we've added dropshadows for `Text2d`. Add the `Text2dShadow` component to a `Text2d` entity to draw a shadow effect beneath its text.
