`wgpu` 25 introduces a number of breaking changes, most notably in the way Bevy is required to handle
uniforms with dynamic offsets which are used pervasively in the renderer. Dynamic offsets and uniforms
of any kind are no longer allowed to be used in the same bind group as binding arrays. As such, the
following changes to the default bind group numbering have been made in 3d:

- `@group(0)` view binding resources
- `@group(1)` view resources requiring binding arrays
- `@group(2)` mesh binding resources
- `@group(3)` material binding resources

Most users who are not using mid-level render APIs will simply need to switch their material bind groups
from `@group(2)` to `@group(3)`.

Exported float constants from shaders without an explicit type declaration like `const FOO = 1.0;` are no
longer supported and must be explicitly typed like `const FOO: f32 = 1.0;`.
